Obama received Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u
The relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u is not just friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about T@@ ehr@@ an ’ s destabili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
However , the meeting should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-@@ state solution under discussion .
The relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel ’ s pro@@ long@@ ed settlement structure and def@@ ends Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u ’ s lack of will in the peace process .
The deal about Iran ’ s nuclear program , referred to by Obama , has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
In March , Net@@ any@@ ah@@ u , at the Republic@@ ans ’ invitation to the US Congress , had delivered a controversial speech , partly viewed as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
The speech was not can@@ cel@@ ed with Obama ; a meeting had rejected it with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
In an emergency call Professor reveals to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend .
In an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told the police that he had shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lam@@ b was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; is still alive and probably fur@@ ther@@ ed , and he said that the family contact of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
Within the House , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was written on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me , &quot; which , according to the Lam@@ authorities , was signed in the letter .
There was no evidence that Lam@@ b , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , had already travel@@ ed 300 miles to the school grounds where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief L@@ ynn Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the talk at 10 : 18 .
He said that Lam@@ b made the fat@@ eful call eventually afterwards .
There was another death until the end of the day : Lam@@ m took his life when the police took him .
One day after gradu@@ ation in the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lam@@ b motivated .
The details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped draw a picture of a tal@@ ented but perhaps difficult teacher .
Stu@@ dents said that they enjoyed their lessons .
The police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he has no history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmi@@ dt himself mentioned Lam@@ b in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
Both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
At the same time there were some inc@@ lin@@ ations to problematic behaviour .
A student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ised Lam@@ b , said that he also seemed a little exc@@ ited and ner@@ vous , &quot; as if something with him was wrong &quot; .
Another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 20@@ 14-@@ 15 .
Lam@@ b had previously asked the Delta State University to investigate for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
This year he taught only two online courses .
Rec@@ ent changes in university employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lam@@ b had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to set up an assi@@ stant professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt , but &apos; there was of course something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s presentation . &apos;
These are questions that Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After the flight from the camp@@ us , the police later found Lam@@ bs trace when he returned to Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
Before he could be arrested , Lam@@ b himself killed himself with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Me@@ th@@ el John@@ son .
His car ran still in the entrance .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went to this House , but John@@ son said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
He received his doc@@ torate in education in spring .
One of the long-@@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ m@@ atic and f@@ unny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when she met with common friends .
They and their friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach their guitar playing for a few years .
At that time , he was the woman &apos;s sal@@ ary .
All girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on hab@@ itable .
Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
In the emergency call , Lam@@ b said &apos; I have killed my wife &apos; , but there was no certificate from a marriage .
They had a dog called Ligh@@ tn@@ ing who lived with them in the bri@@ ck house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
The police said that the dog was in order .
The former husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they had been for@@ ged 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; She was completely destroyed on the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said about his daughter .
They and their mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lam@@ b , but through his daughter A@@ big@@ ail he heard that Lam@@ b was interested in music and blu@@ es played .
Lam@@ b met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and A@@ big@@ ail were both on a summer market three years ago .
Later they played together the one or other G@@ ig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly illumin@@ ated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lam@@ b and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lam@@ b had finished his guitar and m@@ und@@ harmon@@ ik@@ asp@@ iel before a spar@@ se audience .
There were no signs that anything was wrong .
&quot; Just one happy couple &quot; , he said .
We were at the cle@@ aring house and jo@@ y@@ ful with each other .
I think they both had a good sense of shame .
Schmi@@ dt , the dead professor , led the first sem@@ ester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
He was married and had three small children .
He studied at Em@@ por@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Bro@@ ther@@ hood and the Stu@@ dent Committee .
On the Delta State Camp@@ us in Cle@@ vel@@ and , about 900 people attended a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght ceremony on Tuesday evening , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mr@@ s. Li@@ z and his brother J@@ ef@@ f Schmi@@ dt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ guard , while the university cho@@ ir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Gra@@ ce &quot; s@@ ang .
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; We try to move our students back &quot; , said La@@ For@@ ge .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mi@@ ly Wag@@ ster Pet@@ tus in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , and Reb@@ ec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Or@@ le@@ ans contributed to this report .
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lam@@ b made the emergency call after he shot Schmi@@ dt , and that Lam@@ m , in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss , referred to his wife as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R plans to recru@@ it fewer workers for Christmas time .
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seed workers as last year , but the to@@ y and baby product dealer says that he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
The company said that it was planning to recru@@ it 40@@ ,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country , with a workforce of 45 000 still recru@@ ited during the Christmas period of 2014 .
Most jobs will be part-@@ time jobs .
The company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of staff will rise from October to December .
While the holiday itself is still a few months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox jo@@ ins his &quot; Date &quot; with Prin@@ z@@ ess@@ in Di@@ ana .
The premi@@ ere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
It was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; We sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Prin@@ z@@ ess@@ in Di@@ ana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a tra@@ iler for an im@@ min@@ ent documentary &quot; Back in Time &quot; .
The film starts , and it comes to my mind that I am a simul@@ ated ste@@ w and an array length away from being with the Princ@@ ess of Wales at a date .
&quot; Back in Time &quot; , a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future &quot; , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Th@@ omp@@ son and Christop@@ her L@@ loyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer St@@ even Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; Back for the Future &quot; had premi@@ ere 30 years ago .
&quot; It is really for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the greatest time movie ever shot . &quot;
&quot; Back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinema in October .
UN bo@@ ss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General B@@ an Ki@@ -@@ Mo@@ on says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &apos; There is no military solution &apos; of the conflict that la@@ sts almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
The UN head once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the marg@@ ins of the General Assembly minist@@ erial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
He reg@@ ret@@ ted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syri@@ an people and the regional powers &apos; make this situation in@@ sol@@ ub@@ le . &apos;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 surve@@ ys showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
Some have tried to brand him as a fl@@ op .
Others have done away with him as a jo@@ ke .
And some are waiting for a collapse .
But no matter how some Republic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp down from the top ranks on poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not worked .
Ten of the last el@@ even national surve@@ ys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in double-@@ dig@@ it areas , and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate m@@ og@@ ul@@ s .
It is , of course , too early in the parliamentary term .
None claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republic@@ an nom@@ ination .
Exper@@ ts stress that at this time in 2011 R@@ ick Per@@ ry ’ s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of whom won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
But out@@ si@@ ders , such as J@@ eb Bush ’ s Super P@@ AC , and the conservative economic group Club for Growth , now recognize Tru@@ mp ’ s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to flow their dollars to over@@ throw him .
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp ’ s popularity values have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ d@@ acy in mid-@@ June , a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mou@@ th-@@ University showed that only two out of ten Republic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
By mid-@@ July it was 40 percent .
At the beginning of August it was 52 % .
Now six out of 10 Republic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
And these figures are in early states .
A Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ ow@@ a last week found that 60 % of Republic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
Two thirds of G@@ O@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as a candidate .
In a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 % of Republic@@ ans said that they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tru@@ mp were nominated .
Only two out of 10 say that they would be &apos; an@@ gr@@ y &apos; if he were the candidate .
Only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 % say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
The next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bi@@ o with only 21 percent .
On the other hand , 47 % of Republic@@ an voters say that they would be &apos; dis@@ satisfied &apos; or &apos; an@@ gr@@ y &apos; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , were the candidate .
A majority of Republic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp ’ s tem@@ per@@ ament as a problem .
While Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 % of Irish Republic@@ an voters believe that property Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per@@ ament for a president , AB@@ C News / Washington Post on Monday .
The same number applies in the first pre-@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ ow@@ a , where the same 52 % of Republic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a comm@@ ander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
Nevertheless , 44 % think that he does not have the personality to perform effectively , and almost six out of 10 independence say that his tem@@ per@@ ament does not p@@ ate into the White House , says AB@@ C / Post .
Republic@@ an voters get used to the idea .
When they set up their ple@@ dges , Republic@@ an voters consider Tru@@ mp to be real .
If they are asked who wins the G@@ O@@ P nom@@ ination , a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week says four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
This is a change since the time four out of ten July spent their money on J@@ eb Bush .
Full disclos@@ ure : G@@ O@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
At this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republic@@ ans thought that R@@ ick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
Nevertheless , a large number of G@@ O@@ P voters see Tru@@ mp ’ s campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible .
Even if the Republic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is almost always be@@ ating .
Some experts point out that the fragm@@ ented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp ’ s leadership , while anti-@@ trust support is diff@@ used to more than a do@@ zen other candidates .
But a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mou@@ th-@@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head@@ -to-@@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most Republic@@ an candidates , Tru@@ mp receives majority support .
He has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bi@@ o 14 points , before Wal@@ ker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before marg@@ ins Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
It is a head@@ -to-@@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
The only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the <UNK> ur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head@@ -to-@@ head race .
A narrow majority of Don@@ al@@ d-@@ Tru@@ mp fans say that they have formed their opinion .
A new C@@ BS / N@@ Y@@ T pol@@ l on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have won their votes .
Of course , much can be done to change that , and no one can really say that never change opinion .
46 % said that they left the door open to change to other candidates .
Nevertheless , Tru@@ mp ’ s strongest competition at the moment is the other out@@ si@@ der , the neur@@ o@@ sur@@ ge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
Six out of 10 Republic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
Since Donald Tru@@ mp called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; immigrants from Mexico two months ago in his campaign friend , immigration has been at the heart of public dis@@ course to 20@@ 16 .
Some worry that Tru@@ mp ’ s bom@@ b@@ astic pro@@ position will keep His@@ pan@@ ic Americans out of the Republic@@ an Party and damage re@@ orientation efforts .
But after Monday ’ s new AB@@ C / post-@@ pol@@ l pol@@ l , six out of 10 Republic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
So , as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tru@@ mp appears to be doing so .
The fru@@ stration about the government is rising to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of Republic@@ an voters ’ support , especially through their out@@ si@@ der status .
Six out of 10 Republic@@ ans say in the new Monday pol@@ l by AB@@ C / Post , they want a political out@@ si@@ der rather than someone with government experience .
And they are also an@@ gr@@ y at Washington .
A pol@@ l by the Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ ow@@ a two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ ow@@ a Republic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; polit@@ ely anno@@ yed &quot; .
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with views over the North Sea wat@@ t .
In the street , a square met@@ re of a Re@@ et@@ da@@ ch@@ haus costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; On Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price .
A new study shows in which special layers cost one square met@@ re the most .
Of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square met@@ re for a student book in Munich are not really little .
In contrast to Germany ’ s top residential areas , one of the prices is available , but like pe@@ an@@ uts .
The real estate service provider Eng@@ el &amp; <UNK> ers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ re prices in stag@@ gering hei@@ ghts .
There are several tens of thousands of euros ni@@ x - per square met@@ re , not@@ ori@@ ously .
But well , who can afford it ...
By the way : Munich is not at the top , for once .
Champ@@ ions League : Bay@@ ern@@ -@@ Trau@@ m@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
Second go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper in Pir@@ ä@@ us : Bay@@ ern@@ -@@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
A happy hit by Thomas Müller p@@ aved the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olymp@@ i@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ ä@@ us - then ran &apos; s .
A sovereign start of the Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ Le@@ agu@@ e-@@ season .
The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Pir@@ ä@@ us war@@ dro@@ be .
The team of tra@@ iner P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her premi@@ ere in the Champ@@ ions League at the Greek record champion Olymp@@ i@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es Tre@@ ffer ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The t@@ wel@@ f@@ th success in series will be the first step towards fin@@ ale on May 28 , 20@@ 16 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally pick up the ste@@ ering pot to Munich in the third round .
Müller received valuable assistance from Olymp@@ i@@ ak@@ os Tor@@ wart Rober@@ to during his 28@@ th matches in the Champ@@ ions League for the Bay@@ ern@@ -@@ led champ@@ ionship , which led to a f@@ lange of the world champ@@ ionship .
&quot; We will not under@@ estimate them &quot; , Bay@@ ern@@ -@@ cap@@ tain Phili@@ pp L@@ ah@@ m promised to play in the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is-@@ Stadium prior to 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ -@@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word .
They showed a concentrated and committed presentation without sh@@ ining .
Pir@@ ä@@ us had won his latest six home games in the royal class , including not@@ orious clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
In 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund ( 1 : 3 ) also st@@ umb@@ led here .
But Bavaria , un@@ defe@@ ated with Greek teams in seven European du@@ els , did not want to be the next victim .
They were bra@@ vely involved in their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ <UNK> tible to work .
The attacks were too often initiated by game shift to the left side of Dou@@ glas Costa , who rarely passed through the previous Bra@@ un@@ schwei@@ g Om@@ ar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half field suggested in the left upper gate .
In the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave away the possible 2 : 0 .
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
First , when Olymp@@ i@@ ak@@ os St@@ ür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the head ball of the Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
Then by direct acceptance , the Tor@@ wart Rober@@ to par@@ ted with the kne@@ e ( 35 ) .
Although the <UNK> ans raised their usual dominant game , Pir@@ ä@@ us N@@ adel@@ sti@@ che was able to play .
However , on Tor@@ ke@@ eper Manuel Neu@@ er was for@@ gi@@ veness .
For example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye over the L@@ atte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
Before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had to defend a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after mus@@ cular problems back in the k@@ iller , sat first outside .
The World Championship her@@ o gave the green light only after the final training , said sports manager Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; Who wants to do something else , this is already mal@@ icious &quot; .
Also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an to the an@@ gr@@ y Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller set up yet another one .
Pri@@ or to the match there was a tie in the stadium .
After a small group of partially mu@@ dd@@ led Bay@@ ern@@ -F@@ ans in their audi@@ t@@ orium apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pir@@ ä@@ us in words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich fol@@ lo@@ wers .
At least one Bay@@ ern@@ -F@@ an was transported injured from the stadium .
W@@ ho@@ ever smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth .
Those who smoke damage not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - this makes a Pots@@ damer long-term study possible .
The good news : In case of default , the risk falls fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
This is apparent from the long-term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Pots@@ dam .
Compar@@ ed to non-@@ smo@@ kers , the risk was to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ur@@ ely to the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6@@ -F@@ ache higher .
The scientists had observed more than 23@@ ,@@ 300 participants .
The main causes of t@@ ooth failure are c@@ aries and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the t@@ oo@@ th@@ pa@@ ste , under@@ lines the DI@@ f@@ E .
For this par@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
The connection between smoking and loss of t@@ ooth therefore goes back to more frequent infl@@ amm@@ ation of t@@ oo@@ th@@ pa@@ ste in smo@@ kers .
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
People who stopped smoking , however , could reduce their risk within a short time , write researchers in the &quot; Journal of D@@ ental Research &quot; .
However , it may take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of consumer demand , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Di@@ et@@ rich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
People need to be persu@@ aded to become non-@@ smo@@ kers , H@@ einer Bo@@ eing said of the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; <UNK> decre@@ ases life time . &quot;
Not to smoke is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good t@@ oo@@ th@@ <UNK> up to the high age .
In Germany , more than 20 % of the population aged 65 to 74 have been affected by t@@ oo@@ th@@ less@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E reported .
Pre@@ <UNK> studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dec@@ ay .
The new long-term study supports the findings .
Arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter remains of late anti@@ qu@@ ity at Cologne ’ s Rhein@@ u@@ fer .
Once again , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
Near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , Arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Rö@@ mis@@ ch-@@ German@@ <UNK> Museum have excav@@ ated sk@@ el@@ ets and remains of historical buildings , said museum leader Mar@@ cus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , hist@@ ori@@ ans have been searching for so-called natural monuments .
For all construction projects in the Cologne district , the museum is always used as a specialist office for Arch@@ ae@@ ological Land@@ scape Care .
In the third part of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the <UNK> ologists were now five .
From text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church was standing , Tri@@ er explained .
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a gra@@ ve@@ yard with around 350 gra@@ ves was discovered , which probably belong@@ ed to the church .
The Young Women of Frei@@ ght Tra@@ cking
After a young woman at the railway station has been injured in ho@@ stage sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes , the federal police are asking the population to help .
On the morning of Wednesday morning , at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman from the direction of the railway station building cross@@ ed the track at the end of the railway line and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
By collecting the train , it has caused serious in@@ jur@@ ies in accordance with the Federal Republic of Germany .
She was treated on the spot in emergency medical care and was brought to a hospital by rescue workers .
There is no evidence available to the officials concerned about the reason for the young woman &apos;s par@@ aly@@ sis at night .
The incident may have been observed by witn@@ esses or residents have heard acous@@ tic perc@@ ep@@ tions .
In question , residents or p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by come from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ äck@@ er@@ weg , Th@@ om@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission is proposing new courts in dispute over TT@@ IP
In order to def@@ use the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitr@@ ation system .
The controversial private dispute settlement facilities for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system , which is much more traditional in its functioning .
&quot; We want to set up a system that <UNK> citizens &apos; , &quot; said the EU Commissioner responsible C@@ ec@@ ili@@ a Malm@@ ström at the presentation .
The Swedish Presidency intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the United States .
The German Government announced support .
TT@@ IP is the largest free-@@ trade area in the world with 800 million people .
The plans for the reform of the current arbitr@@ ation procedure specifically state that the EU countries and the US are jointly selecting independent judges for a new investment court .
They are to come from the EU , the US and third countries equally .
For the first time , there is also a second instance .
It would allow appe@@ als to be made against judg@@ ments .
Until now , the parties involved in the process have agreed on refer@@ ees , and there has been no possibility of appe@@ als against their judg@@ ments .
In the debate over recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , Mrs Malm@@ ström comm@@ ented .
In the long term , it wants to work according to its own specifications on an international investment court .
There , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved .
The main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP are the investor state arbitr@@ ation procedures ( IS@@ DS ) .
The traditional arbitr@@ ation courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies can pay compensation to taxpayers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a lower@@ ing of consumer and environmental standards .
In initial statements , anti-@@ T@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred to the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
The main criticism has been that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
The German Secretary of State Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SP@@ D ) , on the other hand , described the plans as major progress .
In the reform , the Commission made essential points , which the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el , prepared in spring with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private arbitr@@ ation is out of the table .
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
The European Business Europe Association warned against restric@@ ting economic opportunities by too many new rules .
In particular , small and medium-sized enterprises could be put at a disadvantage as a result of this .
When the talks on the FT@@ A TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ satlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , Wednesday remains unclear .
Neg@@ oti@@ ations have been in progress since mid-@@ 2013 .
However , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
Origin@@ ally , a framework for the agreement should already be in place at the end of this year .
This deadline is no longer ten@@ able .
Deli@@ k@@ ater Fol@@ k by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
It was el@@ even years ago that Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
In addition to him , there is a fli@@ p chart on which the sh@@ y fol@@ lo@@ wers recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with film sti@@ cks .
The entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens lec@@ ture .
He tells about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and z@@ art arranged songs by different places he always recorded on the map .
Where they were born and how it looks there , in his hom@@ eland .
Since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
With the 2003 release and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : The Great Lake State &quot; , sound@@ ly composed songs that are harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American fol@@ ks of the late 196@@ 0s , but can always turn into great op@@ ul@@ ente .
The ru@@ mo@@ urs are that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of an abandoned series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be succ@@ um@@ bed in succ@@ ession .
However , since 2004 and in the R@@ hin@@ eland area , Seven Sw@@ ans has already appeared and is positively breaking certain expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens appears here .
Live meets him guitar and ban@@ jo .
One year later , the musi@@ cian living in New@@ -@@ York returns to the series .
With &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ ise &quot; ) , 2005 will be an elabor@@ ately celebrated master@@ piece .
Over@@ coming ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
The album is growing into the American Bill@@ board Char@@ ts and lacks any annual list of the influential music media .
After very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales pieces .
This sixth regular studio album is still widely or@@ chest@@ rated , but worn by programm@@ ed sequ@@ ences or be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
The smaller clubs have long escap@@ ed , the stage shows are becoming the colourful spectac@@ le of Ne@@ on-@@ Sti@@ r@@ n@@ b@@ rücken and the large flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent stage ens@@ emble .
Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is currently tour@@ ing Germany as part of a five-@@ member band .
In the dark ham@@ burger More !
The theatre mainly presents the &quot; Carri@@ e &amp; L@@ ow@@ ell &quot; that has been available since March .
Although there are now nearly 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the clearly ri@@ ver@@ ed sta@@ ir@@ case returns to intim@@ acy and fol@@ k .
Without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enrich@@ ed album .
The audience is told that the lec@@ ture is &quot; more op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; and that the &quot; plate can basically be thrown away &quot; .
St@@ ev@@ ens is a little bit la@@ vis@@ h , he plays only a few older songs , and finally gets out under to@@ sen@@ des .
Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Deb@@ ut at Prime Minister Question Time
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s ’ s deb@@ ut@@ ure has been eag@@ <UNK> awa@@ ited during the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time .
The new Labour leader , Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is to give his de@@ but at the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time , and to start with David Cam@@ eron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and by the Labour Members near him .
He called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this week &apos;s event .
He also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos; leadership , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
In the meantime , the Labour chairman ’ s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national an@@ them ’ sin@@ king at a commem@@ or@@ ative ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of Tor@@ y-@@ MP@@ s and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention .
A spo@@ kes@@ man from Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that he had &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of England &quot; .
But a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s ’ shadow cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , said in the BBC Two News@@ ni@@ ght-@@ programme that he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national an@@ them , &apos; independent &apos; of his belief that the mon@@ arch@@ y should be abolished .
Almost a do@@ zen shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos; top team , calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
The BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent , Mr Rob@@ in Br@@ ant , says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ ack@@ ed &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and on restric@@ ting profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said to the TU@@ C Conference that Labour is making changes in order to remove the whole idea of limiting it altogether .
H@@ und@@ <UNK> later , Mr Smith , the shadow employment and pensions minister said that the party was &apos; very clear &apos; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chairman , David Cam@@ eron , since he is the go@@ -@@ bo@@ ss , who has been standing in Parliament for the last decade over the disc@@ ard box .
The Labour chairman , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &apos; crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced &apos; ideas for questions to Mr Cam@@ eron and has given him more than 30@@ ,000 suggestions .
The Is@@ ling@@ ton North M@@ P has said that the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time is too prescri@@ p@@ tive , and that he will refra@@ in from being both &apos; f@@ ier@@ ce &apos; and the strike with res@@ ent@@ ment , and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow minister of economics , will represent him if he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cam@@ eron is travelling abroad .
He has also brought up the idea that other colleagues should occasionally speak , and that he raised John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Commons , in order to discuss the problem .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cam@@ eron said that he wanted to move away from the policy of a &apos; casino theatre &apos; , often linked to the Prime Minister ’ s Question Time , but a few years later he acknowledged that he failed to do so .
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliamentary colleagues , even though critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and that far-reaching reforms are needed .

Po@@ ver@@ ty is rising by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the UK
The po@@ und so@@ ared on data showing an increase in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was boo@@ sted by SA@@ BM@@ iller ’ s bid target .
Between May and July , the result , without bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom , grew by 2.@@ 9 % against the same prior year .
Since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and has led to estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates .
The po@@ und rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 , and was raised to € 1.@@ 3@@ 7@@ 30 by 0.@@ 84 % against the euro .
The FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a le@@ ap of 20 % after the tak@@ eover bid of the Ri@@ v@@ ale AB In@@ <UNK> was received .
A transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ wei@@ ser , Stell@@ a Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ ber@@ ry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the ri@@ val group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont .
Ri@@ chem@@ on ’ s latest sales figures suggest all expectations , and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - once again reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose by 5 % after Berg@@ ba@@ uri@@ ese said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his deb@@ t-@@ reduction strategy .
The shares of the Pack@@ aging and Paper Group Mon@@ di were the largest lo@@ sers on the index , with a drop of 4.@@ 3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s set his rating for the company rating to &quot; sell &quot; .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the spor@@ ts@@ wear company reported a pre-@@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the six months .
The bo@@ ss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion .
The Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &apos; more purchasing power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers &apos; .
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs of its company , he says .
The cost could hit J@@ D Sports ’ s expansion plans , he added , and that might mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

The idea brought him a po@@ ster at a P@@ egi@@ da demonstration with the title &quot; pot@@ at@@ oes instead of d@@ ön@@ er &quot; , which he acci@@ dentally had seen on television .
Since then , in his shop there has been a bar@@ bec@@ ue p@@ ad with meat and pot@@ at@@ oes .
&quot; This is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stom@@ ach &quot; , says Al@@ ha@@ y .
The idea has now been submitted to the Patent Office in Munich .
According to the authority , it has recently been protected as a pattern of use .
Therefore , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much pot@@ at@@ oes it contains .
Only so much : &quot; It tastes together even better &quot; , he finds .

Met@@ cash laun@@ ches So@@ il Camp@@ a@@ ign to combat Al@@ di@@ -@@ E@@ mission
Met@@ cash tries to protect the IG@@ A@@ -F@@ ili@@ als from an Al@@ di mar@@ ch in South Australia and Western Australia .
Food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
While Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A super@@ markets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ a@@ ide@@ -S@@ how .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers go on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ <UNK> samples in IG@@ A stores and shop owners who sell tickets for the South Australian Foot@@ ball League to loy@@ al customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol , and equipment runs its annual investor strategy day .
There is a lot at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 % of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A stores and generate higher profit marg@@ ins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A networks in the eastern states .
Bu@@ yers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provin@@ cial and IG@@ A retail@@ ers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
However , an@@ alyst@@ s like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that 12 months after opening his first markets , Al@@ di will cut around 5 % of the food market in these two countries , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly self-employed retail@@ ers .
According to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A retail@@ ers could lose $ 360 million per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year , Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in W@@ A and generate a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said that the loss in food and food stores and the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million before interest and taxes .
At the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Ro@@ y Morgan found that IG@@ A bu@@ yers are the most loy@@ al .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s ’ turnover in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 % in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 % in 20@@ 17 , and 2.1 % in 20@@ 18 , and will reduce the market share from 14 % in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 % by 2020 .
Last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Mel@@ bour@@ ne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
But it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash cont@@ acted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As ’ market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 % since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retail@@ ers , have fallen by 43 % since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction , while pressure on sales and marg@@ ins .
The wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week , and to improve IG@@ A retail@@ ers in improving their stores through fast@@ -@@ growing fresh food and to provide a better choice of private label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s ’ main business leader , I@@ an Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustment and retail adjustment programs will go to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to earnings growth in 20@@ 17 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ al@@ y .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the recent storm surrounding his friend N@@ ick Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ al@@ y , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the tal@@ ented Du@@ o , who is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , was brought into the spot@@ light by the in@@ famous Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os dispute with St@@ an Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Ma@@ sters .
In a f@@ ier@@ ce quali@@ fying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his oppon@@ ent Ry@@ an Har@@ ris@@ on had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Har@@ ris@@ on called : &quot; Wa@@ w@@ rin@@ ka should have be@@ aten Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os , and I should beat the child . &quot;
While he was last seen how he cr@@ ashed a tennis <UNK> er after a cr@@ amp@@ ed a potential US-@@ open bar by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ al@@ y ’ s Kok@@ kin@@ akis was ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly defended .
The teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , competing with S@@ am Gro@@ th for second place in the base behind Bern@@ ard Tom@@ ic in the Dav@@ is Cup semi-@@ final against Britain .
&quot; One thing I know about is the fact that in my view Th@@ an@@ asi was moved a little into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ al@@ y .
He broke a rac@@ quet when he lost to the US Open because of a c@@ ran@@ e , but he is not the first player to break a fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
But , really , he has beh@@ aved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ ris@@ on and so on , and I think he deserves much credit .
He has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too strictly .
He is a very mature 19@@ -@@ year-old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is respected in the dres@@ sing area , he trained hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe his own merits .
He@@ al@@ y also supported the decision not to take Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long-term integral part . &quot;
&quot; First of all , we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Ky@@ r@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ al@@ y .
And I believe that N@@ ick quickly managed the rise , as people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out , and he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions , some time out of the r@@ amp .
Europe ’ s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency status , clos@@ es the border , holds refugees back .
Hungary declared the state of emergency and se@@ aled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and kept all those who tried to enter the country illegally , all with the aim of st@@ opping the flow of migrants .
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants met in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with indi@@ gn@@ ation to Serbian officials .
The people who were fle@@ eing violence were stuck and t@@ ents for an unknown time in a land ri@@ m on the road between the two control points of the countries and settled there .
But frustr@@ ations rose .
As a police helicop@@ ter hang@@ ing over them , the migrants &apos; opened the border ! &apos; and ins@@ ults against the Hungarian border police .
Some have returned food and water from protest .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said that it was &apos; unacceptable &apos; for migrants to be sent back from Hungary , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not coll@@ ater@@ al damage .
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
The tur@@ bul@@ ence at the Hung@@ ari@@ an-@@ Serbian border did not reach a common immigration policy one day after the 28@@ -@@ nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
However , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who sought refuge in the floo@@ ded Italy and Greece , expressing their hope that , after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
On Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent ’ s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neigh@@ b@@ ors .
The emergency that took place on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Meanwhile , the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , said that his country is also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed dra@@ gon@@ flight along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after having completed a f@@ ence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Char@@ lie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison sentences were used during the race to create the bar@@ bed dra@@ gon@@ flight between Hungary and Serbia .
In recent months , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and an entry point for the European Union .
Prime Minister Vi@@ ktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted , however , that most incoming economic migrants are in search of a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany .
The new laws that came into force at mid@@ night in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-@@ met@@ re ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ uns that the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime , and these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; Due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian Government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said government spo@@ kes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
We say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
Parliament still needs to agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ por@@ ters of Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs on Friday already .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had already pen@@ etr@@ ated 45 people in trying to cross the border .
They come across by cor@@ rup@@ ting the f@@ ence , they are now in police cust@@ ody and are accused of prosec@@ uting crimes under the new laws .
Auth@@ orities are in the process of rep@@ air@@ ing the f@@ ence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train carri@@ age with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
Chaos surrounded the main crossing of borders near Ro@@ sz@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd in order to pen@@ et@@ rate them .
About 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
El@@ ection 20@@ 16 : H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton ’ s lead ahead of Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved .
For@@ mer US Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double-@@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton now has support for 47 % of democratic voters in the pre-@@ election ( 58 % earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 % ( 17 % rise ) .
Vice-President Jo@@ e Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidency , receives support from 15 % of the democratic elec@@ torate in the prim@@ aries .
More than five months before the start of the pre-@@ election period , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear what candidates they will support .
But Clinton ’ s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
Since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders has achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but that margin has decre@@ ased .
Their support for men has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back@@ wards .
Clinton ’ s advantage among democratic voters under 50 years of age has become di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a great advantage among the older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double-@@ dig@@ it lead in liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5-@@ point lead in this group .
About half of the pre-@@ election democratic voters say that if they were nominated by the party , they would support Clinton with enthusiasm .
One quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 % would support them only because they are the candidate .
Six per cent would not support them .
Perhaps not surpris@@ ingly , Clinton ’ s current supporters , above all , are enthusiastic about her .
The views are more mixed with those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would support them <UNK> tically .
While 48 % of pre-@@ election democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republic@@ an voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 % ) .
When Clinton ’ s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the worst answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 % ) , according to the view that it is time for a woman to become ( 13 % ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) .
Clinton ’ s supporters also mention their relationship with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
Appro@@ val to deal with the problems and eligi@@ bility are also quoted .
As the vic@@ e-@@ president casts a potential for the presidential office , 57 % of the pre-@@ election democratic voters want to see him in the race - though one-@@ third believe that he should not .
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
Of Clinton ’ s supporters , more than half say that bi@@ ds would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
If Bi@@ den decides not to stand for the Democrats ’ nom@@ ination , H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton ’ s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race , increases to 30 points without him in the race .
Fif@@ ty per cent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure dec@@ lined 78 % last month .
Bi@@ den has by far been second in this measurement , but the percentage he sees as the &quot; most sel@@ ective &quot; has increased .
However , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
Simil@@ ar to last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these pre-@@ election voters appears to be unacceptable .
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in elec@@ ting their party ’ s prim@@ aries .
maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , and equipped with strong leadership skills .
Bi@@ den best cuts out of hon@@ esty among the three candidates , while Clinton ’ s strength is leadership .
Thir@@ ty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 % ) , but 27 % do not agree with him .
Democratic voters of the pre-@@ election elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in line with their views .
In all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
As questions about H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton ’ s use of a personal email address and a server will continue to be asked during the term of office as Secretary of State , most of the pre-@@ election Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter , and say that it has not influenced their views as a whole .
But it is another story in the American public as a whole .
Hal@@ f of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
Public opinion on this was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
Most Americans said that email contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton ’ s general views , although 36 % said that her opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed .
It is mainly Republic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 , who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy by his party ’ s voters , this remains a problem for them as a whole : only 32 % see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
At the same time , 55 % of voters nation@@ ally see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good notes of leadership .
Of the six candidates listed , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son , and Bush are the best in hon@@ esty .
A majority view S@@ anders rather than hon@@ est@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
The error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre-@@ election period is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tru@@ mp on a countr@@ y-@@ by-@@ country pol@@ l .
Ben Car@@ son is behind Donald Tru@@ mp at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l .
The two candidates now lose half of the support of voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republic@@ an voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nation@@ wide , with support growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted before Fox News last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday pol@@ l .
But Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
The pol@@ l also showed that Car@@ son is doing well with demographic groups and over@@ comes Tru@@ mp among Republic@@ an voters with higher education .
The rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and O@@ hi@@ o govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich , has been cut off by Wis@@ cons@@ in Govern@@ or Scott Wal@@ ker , who has fallen the deep@@ est , from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
The former Flori@@ da@@ -@@ Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , former govern@@ or of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Flori@@ da@@ -S@@ en@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bi@@ o are on third place with 6 % .
The error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 Republic@@ an voters in this latest pol@@ l is plus or min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
The latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is on the poll@@ s - he ends at 19 % support for the Republic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
The recent survey by AB@@ C News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
With a view to a Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found a number of page hi@@ stories for the former neur@@ o@@ sur@@ ge@@ on , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp ’ s faith .
&quot; We need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ ow@@ a .
Ba@@ thing temperatures : The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
Even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a tri@@ p to the Mediterranean for bath@@ ers is already enough to find warm water .
A bath in the north or the Baltic should be a little bit of fun at a maximum of 17 degrees .
Some people no longer go to the sea : Maxim@@ al 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
In contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
The Red Sea in Egypt comes at 28 degrees .
Five members of the Bro@@ ther@@ hood are bur@@ dened with the death of a bar@@ n Col@@ le@@ ge-@@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings .
Almost two years after a student died during a vi@@ cious rit@@ ual of a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , mur@@ ders are filed against five people .
Members of the New York Bar@@ ling College Pi@@ -@@ Del@@ ta@@ -P@@ si Bro@@ ther@@ hood brut@@ ally attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory rit@@ u@@ als in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed .
Civil servants said that he had been bur@@ dened with a 30-@@ pin back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal through a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ consci@@ ously .
The members of the Pi@@ -@@ Del@@ ta@@ -P@@ si Bro@@ ther@@ hood did not call the 9@@ 11 emergency telephone number , after Den@@ g became power@@ less and were alle@@ ge@@ dly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police said .
However , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms , and An@@ dy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Bro@@ ther@@ hood to bring advice , said police chief Chris Wag@@ ner at a press conference .
&quot; At this point , the members began to hide est@@ ates and basically put the welfare of the Bro@@ ther@@ hood above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said political leader Wag@@ ner .
He could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his in@@ jur@@ ies .
After an au@@ top@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ lic@@ ted on head , f@@ us@@ el@@ age , and thi@@ ghs with mu@@ st@@ ard force .
&quot; Too many families were destroyed by the Bro@@ ther@@ hood &apos;s par@@ aly@@ sis ; at least one student has been dying every year since 1970 , &quot; said Dou@@ glas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
Bro@@ ther@@ hood and its members must be called to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
A County Grand jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indic@@ t@@ ment for Mor@@ des third grade for the first five members .
Thir@@ ty-@@ two members of the Bro@@ ther@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ing attacks and creating a criminal association .
&quot; We do not just want to make the people involved responsible , but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also call it to account , &quot; said Wag@@ ner at a press conference on Tuesday .
The Bar@@ ut College has banned the Bro@@ ther@@ hood , and the national Bro@@ ther@@ hood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
A rise in interest rates is coming , and the house rate will fall into dis@@ rep@@ ute , bond yiel@@ ds will rise , and the economy will sli@@ p into recession .
We know that .
What we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will last .
In particular , history provides little guidance for the economy .
A recession occurred within just 11 months after the first rate hi@@ ke and la@@ sted 86 months .
The Federal Reserve ’ s aggres@@ si@@ veness in raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial facilities respond .
Therefore , US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization .
Indeed , several variables play a role .
At the end of the day , however , market participants could find that the whole up@@ sur@@ ge of interest rates may have been exagger@@ ated .
&quot; The Fed ’ s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Juli@@ an J@@ ess@@ op , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Econom@@ ics , in a communication to customers .
By contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels , but still to low levels to lead to the sei@@ sm@@ ic shock that many seem to fear .
However , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
This is a view based on historical trends of how some sectors of the economy could respond :
As the market saw last month , anticip@@ ating rate hi@@ kes can make things more vol@@ atile for a while .
As soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; There seems to be a tendency for applications to be de@@ duc@@ ted 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German banking an@@ alyst@@ s in a recent study of what happens after Fed rate hi@@ kes .
More specifically , in the last 35 years , the market is mostly in the up@@ ward trend - about 14 % - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.@@ 6 % ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in the last six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares tends to occur later in the currency cycle and the return starts to decline .
Rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hi@@ kes often encourage them .
In the current case , the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could speed up a recession .
It is not@@ e@@ worthy that GDP will be near its lowest point in the Fed ’ s interest rate hi@@ ke .
According to Deutsche Bank , the 1@@ 18 rate hi@@ kes since 1950 only twice nomin@@ al GDP was less than 4.@@ 5 % .
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.@@ 6 % , few expect it to continue and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter , according to the Atlan@@ ta Fed .
With such a fragile economic backdrop , rate hi@@ kes could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &apos; whether it is different this time &apos; , said Deutsche Bank .
Market participants all year round have focused on raising the Fed ’ s interest rates , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
While many strateg@@ ists and economists believe that the F@@ OM@@ C could author@@ ise an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading represents only 25 % prob@@ ability .
&quot; In our study , all the remin@@ ders from 1950 to present have taken place in a super@@ -@@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre-@@ recession rates have been sha@@ ken very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report .
By contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
The fixed income was also vol@@ atile , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market .
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on equi@@ ties when they change their strategic course .
In the case of bonds , returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / reduction takes place in the cycle .
At the end of the release cycle , bond yiel@@ ds immediately fall , said Deutsche Bank .
The strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer mer@@ ger of returns between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a lower@@ ing of the cur@@ ve .
High interest bonds often produce better returns in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed in@@ com@@ e-@@ an@@ alyst@@ s at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations .
&quot; In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
Sh@@ or@@ t-@@ term interest rates have risen , the yield cur@@ ve is flat , bor@@ rowing has expanded , and vol@@ atility has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
On the whole , companies that deal with the larger part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
M@@ <UNK> ational companies with high debts will be worse off , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; History shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial rate hi@@ ke , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s an@@ alyst@@ s in a report for customers .
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each rate hi@@ ke in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
Companies with high capital yiel@@ ds as well as low vol@@ atility in their shares also transferred their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
Deb@@ t will be a big problem .
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
Out@@ side of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
Au@@ <UNK> could see profits through higher yiel@@ ds , even though experts differ on how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic F@@ M , says fellow Member Andrew B@@ ingham
The Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critici@@ zed the tran@@ smit@@ ter because of his &apos; ou@@ trage &apos;
He argu@@ es that it is increasingly out of commercial ri@@ vals .
He also addressed the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its .
Parliamentary colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Vo@@ ice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic F@@ M , claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the tran@@ smit@@ ter to prove that he does something that private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not do .
The Conserv@@ ative Member , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC bo@@ ss@@ es that the public service radio station is &apos; stup@@ id &apos; and is no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; Radio 3 seems - I use the word &quot; stup@@ id &quot; not like - but it seems to be turning to Classic F@@ M &quot; , he said .
He also addressed the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
The BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
So , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market &quot; , said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General rejected the accus@@ ations , argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education to the public .
What I learned from Radio 3 is that I am not going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
And there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think is really important , &quot; he said .
Ear@@ lier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that more work should be done on eng@@ aging the audience than it did in the past , because the British are less aware of classical music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport , was b@@ lown under fire to push the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
The Tor@@ ry MEP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Vo@@ ice an - the BBC musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma F@@ ai@@ th and Bo@@ y George as judge - was &quot; produced in special BBC manner &quot; .
He added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our own st@@ ables &quot; when the next time it started an entertainment series .
However , he refused to exclude the order of other series of The Vo@@ ice in the future , or to spend money on charging for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose at the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
In the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy .
Exper@@ ts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed spending .
For more than a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ ast@@ ed , and many of Britain ’ s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ o@@ st cities .
But experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
Exper@@ ts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures showed only 7 % growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , then this has always evol@@ ved over time , &quot; said An@@ dy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publish@@ er of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to Gu@@ ardi@@ an .
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when bu@@ yers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
But that is now on the si@@ delines , and we may see that growth is decre@@ asing .
The black@@ -@@ Fri@@ da@@ y-@@ phenomenon imported from America is c@@ ited as a reason for the dec@@ lining turnover .
Exper@@ ts believe that bu@@ yers with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
Last year , five times the average number of bu@@ yers cr@@ ashed around their computers to make their sl@@ ots , and some vend@@ or websites cr@@ ashed .
Exper@@ ts believe that Black Friday , in which the bu@@ yers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent bu@@ yers from making purchases .
A study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spent slightly more than £ 1 online .
For some products such as TV@@ s and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bur@@ ied in Mec@@ ca during the K@@ ran@@ -@@ accident - B@@ in Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned .
The cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first inc@@ ar@@ nation in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia burdens the collapse of some of the vast Sau@@ <UNK> B@@ in Laden ’ s group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the Kr@@ an collap@@ sed .
H@@ und@@ <UNK> of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a cro@@ wn of M@@ ek@@ ka collap@@ sed .
Dre@@ aming filled , largely dres@@ sed in white , the route to gain their respect when the first of the dead sent their last journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ <UNK> em gra@@ ve@@ yard .
The tr@@ en@@ ch proc@@ ession passed over to the Holy Location where only days before a building cr@@ ab cr@@ ashed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then onto the beg@@ ging .
The cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the f@@ uner@@ al when the Saudi king imposed a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of the B@@ in Laden family for the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
The cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beg@@ gar@@ s who were killed when a cr@@ an cr@@ ashed through the Great Central Mos@@ que of M@@ ek@@ kas were carried through the streets .
Among the dead were Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgri@@ ma@@ ge when the cro@@ wn collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual h@@ add@@ le .
Saudi officials have already made it clear that the h@@ add@@ le will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go to the city .
Today King Sal@@ man said that the B@@ in Laden group should not have left the arm of the c@@ ran@@ e when it was not used .
An Arab version of the decre@@ e published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse .
The Engli@@ sh@@ -@@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
At the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed what caused the over@@ throw of the c@@ ran@@ e that collap@@ sed into a courtyard of the Great Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered together before the H@@ add@@ sch that will take place later this month .
The B@@ in Laden Group has not issued statements on the collapse of the K@@ ran@@ s , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
The Royal Dec@@ ree also targeted the group for non-@@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with met@@ e@@ or@@ ologists .

Civil servants said that 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4@@ ,000 ) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount of permanent injured .

B &amp; Q Bo@@ ss says that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ fts@@ men is over .
Britain increasingly emplo@@ ys cra@@ fts@@ men , says Ver@@ oni@@ que La@@ ury
The number of skilled cra@@ fts@@ men from Eastern Europe has sur@@ passed itself
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at cra@@ fts@@ men .
At the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales offices nation@@ wide
From Ru@@ per@@ t St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of Da@@ ily Mail
It is claimed that Britain is laying down its h@@ amm@@ ers and br@@ us@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European cra@@ fts@@ men who carry out the work in their homes .
If you are cle@@ ver@@ ly able to b@@ yp@@ ass a h@@ ammer or a brush to remove walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
Because Britain is increasingly emplo@@ ying cra@@ fts@@ men to carry out home@@ work in their homes , according to the head of the company behind B &amp; Q@@ .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ i@@ que La@@ ury , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the cotton chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled cra@@ fts@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
Therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at cra@@ fts@@ men and close 60 sales out@@ lets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs La@@ ury said that she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q@@ -Sh@@ ops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are taken by women .
At the moment , the men are out@@ weigh@@ ing the staff .
She said that it was necessary to face up to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more ren@@ o@@ <UNK> than they did in the past .
Mrs La@@ ury said : &apos; It still works by a majority of men in our stores .
We need to shift this more towards a balance .
In principle , half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on purchasing articles by women .
Women play a major role in the decision-making process .
Mrs La@@ ury , who is one of only five women at the head of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ constructed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occup@@ ies exactly 50 % of the team with women , including its management and financial leadership .
Mrs La@@ ury said : &apos; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half-@@ year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
Due to the trend King@@ fis@@ her , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
Func@@ tions of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for Mis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in Tri@@ bunal
On Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian vol@@ leyball master A@@ ich / D@@ ob had to answer on the regional court of K@@ lagen@@ fur@@ t for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and in@@ deb@@ t@@ edness .
The def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
One of them was also accused of abuse of office .
He was finally released from this accus@@ ation in May .
The current process has been postponed .
According to General Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ <UNK> , the preliminary investigation revealed that the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from association accounts , which they were allowed to dis@@ pose of in their functions , for private purposes in 2006 to 2011 .
The damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
Sport officials have also been charged for financial crimes .
This fact left the chairman of the spo@@ kes@@ man , Ju@@ dge Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ in .
Neg@@ oti@@ ations are to take place at a later date .
In the event of dis@@ gu@@ ise , the defense stated that the association was not at any time an asset .
The sports func@@ tion@@ aries would only have charged compensation and exp@@ elled the sports club for which they operated from 1982 to 2011 , where they had invested a lot of time and money , from the debts - the passive fraud in 2001 amoun@@ ted to some 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approximately EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 000 ) .
&quot; At that time we were faced with the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; , said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bro@@ t@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of the Financial Office .
With his colleague and fellow Member , he then decided to take up this task .
With all risks .
&quot; We have imposed money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said when it was taken .
The association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
In addition , in the event of financial success , the dis@@ bur@@ sement of expenses would have been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
That is why one part of the expenses were paid out only years later , from 2003 , when a plus had been in the account .
As a result , flat and non-@@ detailed bookings also appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained what happened .
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two def@@ end@@ ants , said the second def@@ endant .
Why the dis@@ bur@@ sements had not been disclos@@ ed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
The association did not have an interest in detail in the financial statement that it was important to have freedom of debt , so the answer was .
When , in 2011 , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the association account against the official investigation for abuse of office .
The def@@ end@@ ants declared that they had been reserves .
This securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known to the club according to his statement .
&quot; Why ? &quot; , the judge wanted to know .
For a long time , the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ator had no answer to that .
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
If anything had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor placed him in the room .
The co-@@ accused had been informed , the func@@ tion@@ ary justified .
This transfer was formulated as &quot; compensation &quot; .
Why compensation ? , judges and public prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know .
The first def@@ endant said that he was not in agreement with this wording because the association was never damaged .
But what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; With that you are all out of the tail@@ or &quot; .
&apos;@@ Do I have a legal representative ? &apos; he asked .
In addition , the official said that he never paid a cent , he had paid only mi@@ le@@ age and salaries .
In addition , he charged the club 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual cost was much higher .
The def@@ end@@ ants were not able to provide accurate documentation for the early years .
They were no longer kept after an operating audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they said .
The second def@@ endant had also taken the mi@@ le@@ age fee .
All b@@ ills have been carried out in cash , and he has to go from his place of residence to the bank of the international market , he said in his statement .
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witn@@ esses .
He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard sp@@ ends another 30@@ ,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been going on for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up .
The positions of the US computer giant He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
As part of its restructuring , the US Technology Group plans to reduce from 25@@ ,000 to 30@@ ,000 jobs in its customer segments .
This meant saving $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) costs , the company announced on Tuesday .
The move will result in a special burden of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs , which has been going on for three years , has not yet been completed .
At the end of 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2@@ ,000 employees .
Sub@@ <UNK> , the He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard share yiel@@ ded 2.@@ 3 percent .
The <UNK> ni@@ an Pal@@ o Al@@ to Group , which was founded with pr@@ inters , is currently divi@@ ding itself : the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new company this year - separated from the more forwar@@ d-@@ looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
Both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
The world ’ s second largest PC manufacturer , Len@@ ovo , recently added a disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services .
In the third quarter at the end of July , the sales of PC and pr@@ inters decre@@ ased by 11.@@ 5 % .
Sales fell by 8 % to just $ 2@@ 5.@@ 4 billion .
Thus , the proceed@@ s returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to change in the industry with a split and massive out@@ puts .
The 76 year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late to the fact that customers buy sm@@ art@@ phones and tab@@ lets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
Whit@@ man ’ s restructuring plans provide a total of around 5@@ 5,000 posts .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts : majority support the Anti-@@ IS-@@ training mission
But direct German soldiers ’ involvement in fighting in Iraq would largely be rejected : 54 % opposed to it , 35 % were in agreement .
The fact that other states are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is positive 61 % .
24 % are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
Cooperation with Syria ’ s rul@@ ers , B@@ ash@@ ar al-@@ Ass@@ ad , reject 51 % of respon@@ dents , and 20 % would be in favour .
29 % were not able to decide .
Auto : Second press day on the 6@@ 6th IA@@ A

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : Viol@@ ence on the Serbian / Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed hundreds of refugees on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke T@@ ren@@ eng@@ as and water@@ wor@@ shi@@ pp@@ ers .
Eur@@ one@@ w@@ s-@@ Kor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the out@@ break of violence at the border control point .
He reported by phone :
A group of refugees broke through the border .
Beh@@ ind it had formed a police line and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water bur@@ ner ready .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones , sti@@ cks and plastic bott@@ les to officials .
The officials initially set up un@@ interrupted p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
After that , the police used c@@ ran@@ es .
A lot of c@@ ran@@ es have been spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
The group has thus been dis@@ solved .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es have now been somewhat reluc@@ tant to withdraw .
A pregn@@ ant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
Children who had inhal@@ ed the t@@ rou@@ ghs are sha@@ ken .
Other refugees were tor@@ n together and were suffering under At@@ em@@ not .
The press spo@@ kes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered in@@ jur@@ ies caused by the use of c@@ ran@@ es and p@@ ep@@ per spra@@ y .
Time for the US Federal Reserve ’ s Cho@@ ice
The world wat@@ ches when the US Federal Reserve meets on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether or not interest rates have been raised for the first time in nearly a decade .
A pol@@ l among 80 economists surve@@ yed by R@@ eu@@ ters found that a little more than half that of last week ’ s view that the Fed will do so now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 – 0.@@ 25 % .
It is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates on N@@ UL@@ L .
&quot; For the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and launch a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Ang@@ el U@@ bi@@ de , head of staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance , trilli@@ ons of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate little inflation .
However , the Fed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sy view of global conditions .
It warned markets to stop rising , but the signs suggest that the chances of taking such a step are good .
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday .
De@@ ath@@ ers at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology
After the shooting and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he &apos; sorry &apos; at the first murder and wanted &apos; he could make it un@@ heard of on Tuesday &apos; .
The police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , said that Lam@@ b , lec@@ tur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and said that he shot on someone and killed someone .
Lam@@ b told the emergency call center staff that the police had to send police polic@@ emen to his home .
He said , &apos; I shot my wife yesterday evening &apos; and he also mentioned that a &apos; sweet dog &apos; is in the house , but that &apos; no one will be distur@@ bed &apos; , but is likely to be up@@ set .
The police asked the call@@ er about his name , but he did not give him .
Lam@@ b gave no explanation for his shots .
When police che@@ ated the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lam@@ b , 45 who said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me &quot; .
After writing the note , Lam@@ b dro@@ ve 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmi@@ dt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen killed him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmi@@ dt , but &apos; there was of course something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s presentation . &apos;
Despite reports on Monday that Lam@@ b alle@@ ge@@ dly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmi@@ dt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ ang@@ ular relationship &quot; .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that she was married about seven years , as a &quot; good man &quot; .
The two were for@@ ged 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground &quot; .
He said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog called Ligh@@ tn@@ ing , met Lam@@ b for about three years .
&quot; She always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
The police said that Lam@@ b called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; he do not go into prison &quot; .
When polic@@ emen sei@@ zed him on High@@ way 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lam@@ b sent his car to the side , fl@@ ed on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in the spring of 2015 from Delta State University , as his life l@@ au indicates on the university ’ s website .
Stars that have lost their We@@ ak@@ ers
The actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stres@@ s@@ ful years .
In 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ em@@ ia , and in 2009 he lost his long-@@ standing partner , Far@@ ra@@ h F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
The actor also alle@@ ge@@ dly has to cont@@ end with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug owners .
I am sure that all of this will take its toll .
Eur@@ ow@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group .
Hal@@ f a billion euros a year , the Lufthansa Group alone wants to save with a better organisation .
150 of the world ’ s around 1000 exec@@ u@@ tives will cost the company to work .
However , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ating the low-@@ cost Eur@@ ow@@ ings .
The aim of the real@@ ign@@ ment is to provide a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and proceed@@ s syn@@ ergy , which the airline reported on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
The Eur@@ ow@@ ings low-@@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible for this purpose .
In the Management Team for Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ul@@ rich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eur@@ ow@@ ings in the future .
With the new edition , Spo@@ hr empha@@ sizes the importance of Eur@@ ow@@ ings , with which the Group intends to oppose Ry@@ an@@ air and Eas@@ y@@ jet in the future .
To date , the organization of the 120 000 employees of strong company has been complex .
The airlines operated under the umbr@@ ella of the Pass@@ age Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
New negotiations with the pil@@ ots
In the collective bar@@ gaining dispute with the pilot association Cock@@ pit ( V@@ C ) , the negotiations will be resumed after the judicial stop at this Thursday .
That was what the trade union told us .
The subject of the talks is to be the pil@@ ots ’ retirement scheme .
Cock@@ pit wanted &quot; in a year with a forecast record result &quot; to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible .
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
In addition to the pilot ’ s transitional provision , the background is the savings concept &quot; W@@ ings &quot; .
In the fight against competitors , Lufthansa envis@@ ages reloc@@ ating routes to the group ’ s own low-@@ cost Eur@@ ow@@ ings line .
Under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning in the South &quot; , paintings by Le@@ ena K@@ rü@@ ger are to be seen in the artist &apos;s house .
The Finnish resident in Gö@@ tt@@ ingen for a long time has put together a selection of ti@@ rel@@ ess works for the White Room of the House , which anim@@ ate their vie@@ wers to go on a journey with gratitude .
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double questions
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ ction of his right leg at the Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ Le@@ agu@@ e-@@ defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
While this will bring the left external def@@ ender to the wine and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
The injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 years old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
He was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxy@@ gen before he was brought to hospital .
Van Ga@@ al said : &apos; He has a double leg and is in hospital &apos; .
He will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very difficult and then plays fantas@@ tically , and then it happens .
In the dres@@ sing cabin he had an oxy@@ gen mask .
He w@@ ou@@ ld@@ st .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double question , it will take six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the im@@ position of an el@@ eph@@ ant .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ z@@ zo@@ li , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
Van Ga@@ al susp@@ ected that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
You can judge for yourself when I say that an el@@ eph@@ ant and a red card were due .
It was a very serious attack with both legs .
A T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account said : &quot; I thank you all for your messages .
To this end , Manchester United is suffering the loss of Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PS@@ V .
The British def@@ ender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June .
Phil@@ li@@ p Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; It is a very serious injury . &quot;
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an oppon@@ ent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break@@ down when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al ’ s Dutch team at the 2010 World Cup .
&quot; He is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the oppon@@ ent , and if you hear that it is a very serious injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Lu@@ ke .
In talks with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about this , and I am so sorry .
The PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try game by Chris Sm@@ alling .
Sur@@ ely David Cam@@ eron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child lo@@ ves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost exhau@@ sted .
Unless you are perhaps David Cam@@ eron .
When asked by a child care provider to name his favorite children ’ s book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , Dr Se@@ uss ’ s 1971 environmental label .
It was a difficult choice , writes Cam@@ eron in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; f@@ unny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far &quot; .
Everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cam@@ eron alle@@ ge@@ dly describes the action of the book , instead re@@ produces a table of content of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; In the middle of the silent city of Th@@ need@@ -@@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the hearts of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; he read .
As if that were not susp@@ icious enough , the text presented by Cam@@ eron reads in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the web site of Internet Mo@@ vie Dat@@ ab@@ ase and starts as follows : &quot; In the stup@@ id city of Th@@ need@@ -@@ Vil@@ le , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy hopes to win .
Although he ad@@ mits to being a pragmatic father , it seems unlikely that Cam@@ eron is so un@@ familiar with the book ’ s actions , where an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the mon@@ e@@ y-@@ po@@ uring trees , fal@@ ters of th@@ an-@@ stri@@ cken on@@ ce-@@ sh@@ atter@@ ing On@@ ce-@@ sh@@ attered despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , is s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed .
Most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who The Lor@@ ax did not read 20 times after one child .
A Down@@ ing Stre@@ et-@@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ eron ’ s constituency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ eron ’ s staff , but did not give any further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
To meet Pakistan in the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates is a difficult task , but if you see the k@@ iller that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3-@@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not rule out an out@@ ward victory .
Ala@@ sta@@ ir C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the one three years ago , but there are good sp@@ in-@@ players in the b@@ att@@ ling , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
With the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as Sp@@ in@@ -B@@ ow@@ ler and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ hi@@ d , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
This message : Adam Ly@@ th dis@@ appears from the English flag and is replaced by A@@ lex H@@ ales .
The decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult for me to analyse as his chief tra@@ iner in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
There were no question marks at Jo@@ e R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , as - and I said earlier - players are their own best selection .
A long time ago , Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny .
If we hope to see more le@@ ases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
The English coach , Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss , pra@@ ised his position , even if he did not perform so well , and that does not surprise me ; he is , above all , a team man .
The question of how much time a test@@ -@@ dru@@ mmer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like S@@ am Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Comp@@ ton got nine .
Only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and abroad .
The only criticism that can be lev@@ elled was that England first introduced Jon@@ athan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in maximum shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
A@@ lex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a dru@@ mmer whom I greatly appreciate .
He is an X fac@@ tor@@ -@@ cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he reached 23@@ 6 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
He must be given at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of a team in the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates .
The idea of be@@ ating Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would provide an extra sp@@ ine and get four qu@@ ic@@ ks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a dru@@ mmer cannot beat there , and this lin@@ k@@ age has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
My former team colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
He managed three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the k@@ iller as a back@@ -up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man very much .
People may see their statistics - on average 31 with the rac@@ quet and 35 with the ball - and think it is a p@@ unt , but there are no large number of back@@ -up donors who raise their hands and the train@@ ers have decided for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Apart from the team , England has made a few cle@@ ver addi@@ tions to the training session .
The nom@@ ination of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the Sri L@@ ank@@ an B@@ ats@@ man , as an advis@@ er to the test games could be a master@@ piece .
He is one of the n@@ ett@@ est cand@@ les of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for international cri@@ cket competition as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insi@@ ghts from which we can benefit .
Sometimes new voices in the dres@@ sing cabin can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what was said previously .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , will not be used at the one-@@ day , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia , and for my part I have no problem with it .
Some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team perform@@ ers do not determine the schedule .
And you need to remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
Such decisions will not be taken ligh@@ tly .
The Bre@@ x@@ it@@ -L@@ ager ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could win an award if the economy gets into a tra@@ p by 20@@ 17 .
David Cam@@ eron ’ s imp@@ ec@@ cable ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jer@@ em@@ y , &apos; Is it Yes or No ? &apos; Cor@@ by@@ n to Labour leader or TU@@ C , who is heavily tor@@ n for Europe on Tuesday .
Foreign countries also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Nig@@ el Far@@ ages .
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states , as deeply involved in various crises as the EU is now , and not always on their own fault , are tired of agen@@ das created by Britain itself with divided concessions and dis@@ rup@@ tive treaty changes , which they usually do not want .
In Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ <UNK> social protection .
We could also call it Da@@ ve and Geor@@ ges Sel@@ f Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb at summ@@ its or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
It is always a question of me .
My European friend , who wants an out@@ war@@ d-@@ looking United Kingdom inside the EU post - &apos; Don &apos;t let us talk to France alone &apos; , says Berlin - and is showing that more and more short-@@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capit@@ als have come to the point at which they do not care whether or not we stay .
Germany ’ s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the exc@@ essively long ends like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) , and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France ’ s Franç@@ ois Holl@@ ande looks at his re-@@ election or replacement in 20@@ 17 .
It is also a verb@@ al force .
Poland may soon be left with a nation@@ alist right-@@ wing government , Spain .
It is difficult to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the Sel@@ fi@@ e-@@ British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Russia from leaving the UK - something they do not want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies .
Therefore , some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally plan un@@ helpful remarks , especially in S@@ N@@ P style , while Britain ’ s 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; The ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a default &quot; and &quot; Britain won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at its expense , and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony B@@ enn , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They can be scar@@ c@@ ely reminded of Bor@@ is John@@ son , the Er@@ z-@@ Euro-@@ opport@@ un@@ ists , who has made a name as a &apos; EU-@@ Ger@@ ade@@ -B@@ an@@ anen &apos; in Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
In all of his fol@@ ly , E@@ d mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
This included the Med@@ ley of Ta@@ x Fe@@ ar S@@ cor@@ es , Tel@@ eph@@ one H@@ ack@@ ers , and the p@@ seu@@ do non-@@ Indi@@ ans who hold most of our great newspapers .
Ac@@ tually , Tony Blair thought similar to her , but found that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , you better distribute ban@@ anas to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
Indeed , mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ an than Blair himself , when he opposed Cam@@ eron ’ s refer@@ endums , because Blair had imposed the principle of the EU ’ s un@@ en@@ acted constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened his back door to him .
The press has never mis@@ led him .
But the nice Jer@@ em@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday in West@@ min@@ ster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch ’ s strategy of the 8@@ 0-@@ year , a mistake at that time and today .
It may take time , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BB@@ C@@ -S@@ of@@ a he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position on Europe is - I say it very kin@@ dly - in development .
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
Well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blood glu@@ co@@ se spre@@ ads and the more fer@@ tile winds of Tor@@ ys ’ little Engli@@ sh@@ ism can all say &apos; yes &apos; .
It is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One B@@ enn , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; B@@ enn said on radio and on television this week when the pris@@ oner fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 7@@ 0-@@ year period when his old father came on television to be il@@ loy@@ al to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ary ’ s battle was even more attractive .
But to fight to stay &apos; under all circumstances &apos; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants and members of parliament after all the reports on their Monday night &apos;s cru@@ ise .
Whatever the per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve bot@@ tom@@ -up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - statistical discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and , above all , in the stru@@ del of the social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ <UNK> .
It is right not to give Cam@@ eron a card for Europe that allows him to consider Labour ’ s support in the referendum campaign to be self-@@ evident , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
But Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn ’ s fundamental ambigu@@ ity about EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite si@@ ege economy , their anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among left-@@ wing dis@@ si@@ dents , for whom nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism is a central principle of do@@ gm@@ atic disputes .
As with his ambi@@ gui@@ ties to Nat@@ o - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their sup@@ eri@@ ors at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ str@@ ust voters - in order to make concessions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya , and Syria , even with a reduction in the power of the Tor@@ y Government , which I was reminded of when I started on Monday of something called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
Exper@@ ts critic@@ ise the report by Public Health England on e-@@ cigar@@ ettes
Stat@@ ements by a state-@@ funded agency that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking origin@@ ated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
Exper@@ ts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined L@@ anc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e-@@ cigar@@ ettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; .
But some researchers have ques@@ tioned the vulnerability of data and pointed to connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
A edi@@ torial in the medical journ@@ al L@@ anc@@ et last month attacked the &apos; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &apos; on which PH@@ E founded its most important conclusion .
Two other researchers write to BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; .
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygi@@ ene and Tro@@ p@@ ical Medic@@ ine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clin@@ ical Ep@@ ide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Li@@ ver@@ pool , said : &quot; A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
You said that the public expects PH@@ E &apos;s claim that &quot; the current best estimate is that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and model@@ ing .
Indeed , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary decision analysis ( Multi-@@ C@@ <UNK> a Decision Analy@@ sis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to summ@@ arise their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine products ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a spons@@ or of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose directors had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ <UNK> ( B@@ AT ) for an independent study .
He also signed the references from B@@ AT to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that funds should be received from an e-@@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the funding it was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Phili@@ p Mor@@ ris International , according to reports , they added .
The reasons for selecting members of the board are not provided , but these include several well-known e-@@ cigar@@ ette champ@@ ions , some of which also provide industry funding in the paper .
Some other participants at this meeting are not aware of their know-how in tobacco control .
The meeting also included the tobacco management of PH@@ E .
The research work of the group &quot; identi@@ fies &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria &quot; , wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
However , none of these links or restrictions is discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the alleg@@ ations of PH@@ E that &apos; there is no evidence so far that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes serve as a way of smoking for children or non-@@ smo@@ kers &apos; were pre@@ mature .
Pro@@ f Kev@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at PH@@ E , said that BM@@ J ’ s claims had already been re@@ acted be@@ foreh@@ and .
He said : &apos; E-@@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking &apos; .
Every second life-@@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to this , but that we continue to study the long-term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks relative to tobacco .
N@@ early 80@@ ,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System £ 2 billion per year .
By clearly showing current evidence that e-@@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but represent only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national competence .
BBC should give E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 .
The former chairman of Channel 4 , Lu@@ ke John@@ son , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders and The Vo@@ ice , saying that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for Hitler shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
John@@ son said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
He critici@@ zed the BBC for placing public-@@ law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in tough disp@@ uted tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ iors such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
After the BBC Director@@ -@@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , John@@ son said that for six years he tried to get into contact with the BBC without success at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; said John@@ son to the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC .
If you want to keep the radio fee , which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least place your production on programmes that others do not do or place on behalf .
They send The Vo@@ ice in a first-class window of time because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
The idea that no one else would show this is a jo@@ ke , it is ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense .
John@@ son said : &apos; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funding programmes that could be financed without subsidies .
The Vo@@ ice is one such program , E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
To be honest , other channels would give their right arm to do so .
I would like to see how this should be public television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
John@@ son , a business@@ man for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for ratings &quot; because of the ambitions of the people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support &quot; .
His comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like E@@ ast@@ En@@ ders .
John@@ son said that the more public-@@ law ni@@ che programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where the public can hardly measure , but they perform their duties , and they can argue when they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify £ 4 billion radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen .
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
On the radio fee , John@@ son said to the committee : &apos; I call on you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions for who can get the best value from it .
Of course , you all think we all think that there is a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if that is true , because they do not consu@@ me much from the BBC .
The former Sky@@ - and Channel 5-@@ head David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , said that the BBC should review its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &apos; to inform , train and maintain &apos; .
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on radio - and it should take an example to public television broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada to &apos; inform , clarify and maintain &apos; .
On the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms he said that only a hand@@ ful of television is shown , and with the commercial channels alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
<UNK> sts have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with genetically modified ner@@ vous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
The tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses that have too high frequ@@ encies for the human hearing to be heard .
The impul@@ ses work through the activ@@ ation of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the mem@@ bran@@ e channels that respond to ul@@ tr@@ <UNK> waves .
Continu@@ e on this topic : Res@@ ear@@ chers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a series of brain , heart and mus@@ cle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , Res@@ ear@@ chers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Gu@@ ardi@@ an that one day the procedure could replace deep@@ -@@ brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asi@@ ve procedure that gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson ’ s disease .
F@@ aden@@ wor@@ ms usually do not respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a flu@@ id with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
The bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves that then pen@@ et@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
The ampli@@ fied ul@@ tr@@ <UNK> waves affect structures called TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels and found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the wor@@ m cells .
The sound waves bring about the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
In order to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ os wear TR@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels .
When he applies ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they switch the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
The process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons off and off with impul@@ ses of light .
But Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
In contrast to light that must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fi@@ ber , low-@@ frequency ul@@ tr@@ <UNK> tissue can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; We believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the intended human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neur@@ ological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
Other applications could focus on mus@@ cle cells and ins@@ ul@@ in-@@ producing cells , he added .

They played with the inv@@ ention of a more realistic corporate adverti@@ sement , but &apos; through the inser@@ ts with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &apos;
&quot; You have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair &quot; , says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be tra@@ ded illegally on our door@@ step .

Ei@@ ght golden rules for life in student resi@@ den@@ ces
Ele@@ ven years ago , as a self-@@ forgotten 19@@ -@@ year-old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ mile of those whom I anno@@ yed - and to the numerous long-@@ standing complaints about others .
Most of what I learned can be di@@ still@@ ed into eight simple rules .
The entry into student resi@@ den@@ ces ranges from easy to ner@@ ve to absolutely sho@@ cking .
It is temp@@ ting to sha@@ ke : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor h@@ ate because in Ernst , J@@ ungs , it is only a wit@@ ch extract HA@@ H@@ A , I am in my room &quot; .
Bre@@ a@@ the through .
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
It di@@ stra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , unlike those you would not speak with , even if your ey@@ eb@@ rows were on fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers .
Let people .
People ’ s rooms are often transformed into be@@ verage recip@@ es , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people move and make their under@@ wear .
To this end , do not think of starting a relationship with one another .
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts receive a rough treatment at the university .
Your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ den@@ ces form a spati@@ al space club culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-@@ long friendship .
That can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
Nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I used to inter@@ act with you . &quot;
Try to feel when a comm@@ ilit@@ ary is exhau@@ sted - and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
Spe@@ aking of kno@@ cking : do it .
A guy in my student resi@@ den@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ closed door was an invitation .
He saw some things .
Fri@@ end@@ ship close by b@@ aking .
As you begin the <UNK> at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less od@@ d than the gre@@ eting of the 19@@ 50-@@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have bak@@ ed you something so , and now please s@@ mile if I give you a few questions .
Off@@ ering hom@@ em@@ ade delic@@ acies is a good way to make friends .
Your local people feel obliged to talk and may eventually associ@@ ate your face with a tasty surprise .
Of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
Bad mixed cl@@ umps of flo@@ ur , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when you kno@@ ck on .
To ste@@ al food is a common crime in student resi@@ den@@ ces .
Of course , the cla@@ y of ch@@ icken is a th@@ eft , but is it also taking a drop of milk for your tea ?
Check this with the dairy owner .
The chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they co@@ ok inside .
If someone sti@@ cks your stuff , that is anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy - but try to do more balanced than my fellow worker , who added a spo@@ on to their milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
It is now in prison .
You should not make a noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
It is not just a question of being a decent man , but that you are , in the tru@@ est sense of the saying , one of the people sitting in the glass house .
A girl on my corrid@@ or asked her neigh@@ b@@ ors whether it makes them feel a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a check in the morning .
They responded to this with even lou@@ der music .
When they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;@@ clock , they kin@@ dly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , closed their doors and came to their three-@@ hour test .
Would it not be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to be in the same student residence ?
On the other hand , would it not be fundamentally embar@@ rass@@ ing if you keep a co-@@ worker for your future marriage partnership , go to them , go back and see them every day and perhaps experience how they bring all the friends together ?
Of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot person definitely is not your future marriage partner , try at least to give a little reason to your ab@@ om@@ ination .
In the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying f@@ einer is as it seems .
A good tri@@ ck is f@@ unny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a b@@ um@@ per .
Sp@@ end a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety through clubs - but never forget someone &apos;s room with t@@ oo@@ th@@ pa@@ ste and sham@@ po@@ o .
Conn@@ ect their door , and put their keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the free@@ zer - but stop fix@@ ing their limits on the ceiling more than twice .
Rei@@ h@@ enhäuser for Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es , Le@@ ader , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ter
The real estate contrac@@ tor Markus Gil@@ dner buil@@ ds Rei@@ h@@ enhäuser for people who do not have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of Rei@@ h@@ enhäuser .
So for refugees , for example , but also as a signal : &apos; Not only do refugees need housing , but also the mother and the car@@ eless &apos; .
&quot; I understand how to build well and che@@ ap@@ ly today , &quot; says the 4@@ 4-@@ year-old in the interview .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of refugees will push for the housing market .
The <UNK> ur Markus Gil@@ dner believes that housing can be created quickly in a favor@@ able way : it buil@@ ds in a project Rei@@ h@@ enhäuser for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
What solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : The mass accommodation in containers or tur@@ n-@@ tra@@ ys has no sustainability .
Because the people stay here for a large part .
In view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient housing over the next few decades .
A completely ban@@ al three-@@ stor@@ ey ter@@ ra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : A ter@@ rif@@ ic house needs the least space .
It facilit@@ ates integration .
This is different if people are brought into the living blocks .
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three units for each of four asylum seekers .
Each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
It may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back .
Then the houses can be easily re@@ built according to their needs .
What are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without property .
That is man@@ age@@ able .
The building la@@ sted six months .
That is appropriate .
Have the construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : My project has been done correctly .
In particular , it always makes the threat of Dam@@ oc@@ les special construction and the Pl@@ ate Regulation difficult .
Gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
It is still subject to who creates three apartments in a ter@@ ra@@ ced house , at least three pit@@ ches are needed .
It is only in the cities that there is no room for this .
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
How did the residents respond to their Rei@@ h@@ enh@@ aus@@ s project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
What is definitely not true .
But do you not exacerb@@ ate competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : After all , we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford more .
My project has the message , even ordinary people need housing .
It is not only refugees , but also the mother who is a single mother or a little worker .
I would like to say how good and good things can be built today .
That is what this is all about .

i@@ OS 9 : How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released .
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Sett@@ ings Ap@@ p , typ@@ ing on &quot; General &quot; and then selecting &quot; Software Update &quot; .
If it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
Some have encountered problems after the installation because they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed &quot; .
To avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the crash goes back or try to update via i@@ Tunes .
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
This may mean del@@ eting app@@ s to create space - but Apple has made this less likely by stream@@ lining the update , and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete app@@ s and then re@@ install them as soon as the process is completed .
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a char@@ ger so that the battery is loaded .
If the charge is too low , Apple will not allow the update to continue because the phone may be swit@@ ched hal@@ f@@ way and this may lead to a break@@ down of the update .

&quot; Not only are many of the benefits of the funds not used because the complexity of the insurance companies is barely understood , &quot; explained the new hou@@ se@@ wife J@@ ut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Ant@@ on@@ ist and the Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Hospital and for the out-@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; .
In addition to the consultation , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
To this end , the S@@ alu@@ dis was taken by boat .
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as contrac@@ eption , non-@@ training or physi@@ o@@ therapy .
The offers offered by the Sen@@ i@@ or@@ enz@@ entrum and the S@@ alu@@ dis are in an ideal way .
S@@ alu@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; The Sen@@ i@@ or@@ enz@@ entrum for care and care &quot; , described Hei@@ ke Ri@@ ed@@ el , managing director of S@@ alu@@ dis .
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre is that both business leaders are particularly concerned with demographic change .
This is because it makes good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of B@@ am@@ berg essential in the future .
In addition , the may@@ or Wolfgang M@@ etz@@ ner ( SP@@ D ) under@@ lined at the inau@@ g@@ ural cerem@@ on@@ ies , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ amt also devoted itself to the age of association : &quot; There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular social gathering &quot; .
In this way , the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .
The Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 : 00 to 14 : 00 , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

It is special for our team to play against a third party .
We therefore hope for numerous spec@@ t@@ ators , and this is not without reason , because floo@@ d-@@ light games have a special attraction .

Vi@@ enn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang 9@@ 2-@@ year-old died
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of the Vi@@ enn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
He already passed away on September 5 , at the age of 92 , as the artist house announced on Tuesday .
With M@@ ang , the artist house lost an hon@@ or@@ ary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the twen@@ tieth century in Vienna &quot; , as stated in the broadcast .
Born in Vienna in 19@@ 22 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna and Friedrich L@@ ehm@@ ann during and after World War II .
Since 195@@ 2 he worked as a fre@@ el@@ ance architect , but also as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Form@@ ation .
In the 1980s , he was commissioned to create the Sch@@ atz@@ k@@ ammer in the Vienna Hof@@ burg and to re@@ build the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ wi@@ tz into the Austrian theatre museum .

Men Be@@ ating on 17@@ -@@ year-old <UNK> ans
The police are looking for an incident in Bad So@@ den@@ -S@@ al@@ send : on Friday night , at 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ sen@@ ster .
One from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called them to wait for him .
At that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ f-@@ stop .
There were also three people on the site of the pet@@ rol station .
One of these men now scre@@ am young people and beat them in their face with the f@@ ist .
The victim suffered a n@@ as@@ al break@@ age and ble@@ w heavily out of the nose .
When his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff , he first let him off his victim .
From his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
The perpet@@ r@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car to their apartment and demonstr@@ ably passed over there several times .
When you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
He was attacked there again by the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff and another male person .
Under the au@@ sp@@ ices of a stro@@ ke , one applied to the face and the head of the victim .
The injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
To date , there is only one vague description of the event .
One of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters large .
The second rac@@ quet should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres large and had been dres@@ sed with a je@@ ans and a brown white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field au@@ ses and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros .
Sil@@ via Müller and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ au@@ sen .
In addition to this , there are also Sam@@ t@@ parish may@@ ors Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann , Business Development in U@@ ta Sei@@ m-@@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ f Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
In many places in the country there are doctors - As@@ endorf has luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field au@@ ses on 1 October .
While Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ au@@ sen is reti@@ ring , her husband Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich is still standing with a half-@@ job in the next few months .
After a reconstruction phase , Müller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
It was sympath@@ etic at first gl@@ ance , when the field out@@ si@@ ders met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Sil@@ via Müller G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her medical education in the Ver@@ den@@ er Hospital and wants to enter into practice in the coming year .
&quot; We always had in mind that the rub@@ bers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ au@@ sen and lau@@ ghs .
&quot; When it was so far , I just called it &quot; .
The E@@ h@@ ep@@ aar Müller liked the idea of doing its own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us &quot; , says the 3@@ 9-@@ year-old Müller .
&quot; We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years &quot; .
He also sees him as an advantage to be his own bo@@ ss soon .
And so one was agreed that the rub@@ bers bought the house with the practice .
However , they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
The family father Frank Müller also grew up there , his medical studies in Han@@ over followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
At the moment he is working as a doctor in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Emer@@ gency Officer in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is hon@@ or@@ ary in the DR@@ C ’ s read@@ iness for Bru@@ ch@@ haus@@ en-@@ Vil@@ sen .
From 19 September practice will be prepared for the new bo@@ ss .
During the surgery Dr. Kar@@ l-@@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ au@@ sen works as a hou@@ se@@ wife , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alizes in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
The rub@@ bers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as domestic doctors .
&quot; The end@@ o@@ sc@@ op@@ y comes out &quot; , says the 3@@ 8-@@ year-old Sil@@ via Müller G@@ ong@@ oll .
After the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long-term and release EC@@ G and need a voice room more .
In addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
A grant of a total of EUR 50@@ ,000 will be received by the land@@ l@@ ords ( EUR 25@@ ,000 ) as well as by the Sam@@ t@@ Community ( EUR 12@@ 500 ) and the Mun@@ icip@@ ality ( EUR 12@@ 500 ) .
&quot; This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues &quot; , empha@@ sizes Sam@@ t@@ Commun@@ deb@@ ür@@ ger@@ meister Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann .
According to Sil@@ via Müller G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients enter the practice of field au@@ ses every quarter , in the nor@@ th@@ ern@@ most German average practice it is about 500 .
In As@@ endorf there is another home@@ opath@@ ic practice .
A positive side effect of Frank Müller &apos;s practical acceptance : the <UNK> acy remains in As@@ endorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ au@@ sen .
If no successor had found himself , it would have gone .
In fact , anyone who visits land@@ l@@ ords will continue to look mainly in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fields .
With their departure , an era ends in As@@ endorf , after all the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; At the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel rec@@ alls rock ro@@ ses sm@@ iling .
A little bit of hum@@ ili@@ ation they already feel after the long time .
&quot; But we continue to live in Hoh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients still often , &quot; says the intern@@ ist .
Your man compl@@ ements la@@ vis@@ h : &quot; We have a 600@@ 0-@@ square meter lot . &quot;
&quot; So far , I have always pressed for hor@@ ticul@@ tural work , now that could be different &quot; .

Croatia : &apos; We leave the refugees through &apos;
&quot; Now border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; said interior minister <UNK> a Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner .
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum can also make this &apos; self-@@ evident &apos; .
People ’ s care and safety are at the for@@ efront .
However , it is also clear that &apos; it needs clear signals &apos; , the Minister said .
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited mi@@ grat@@ ory flows , not even through the <UNK> an-@@ Slovenian border .
There needs to be a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &apos; corrid@@ or &apos; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia would allow incoming refugees to travel further to Austria and Germany , and that it might also set up corrid@@ ors for the refugees .
However , this was not the case for interior minister V@@ es@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ i@@ bach .
The idea of corrid@@ ors is &apos; absolutely unacceptable &apos; , but Slovenia will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border , particularly with Hungary .
The border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area .
As the Minister pointed out , <UNK> in so doing does not want to con@@ verti@@ ble its borders for refugees .
&quot; Every EU member must fulfil his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
As the Croatian Government said , the first refugees had already been trying to pass through the border crossing of To@@ var@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia on Tuesday night to avoid registration .
The Croatian police were able to take them up in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
According to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatian To@@ var@@ nik since then .
It is mainly about Syri@@ ans and <UNK> ans , including many women and children .
Even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
In the next few days , his country , with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Inter@@ ior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo on the <UNK> an-@@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday in agreement .
However , the government in Bel@@ grade concluded that it was they who indicated that people would go down certain routes : &apos; neither can we nor do we want to do so &apos; was said .
According to media reports , at least in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , and more buses would be expected during the day .
About Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The in@@ m@@ ates were travelling all night from the <UNK> onian border , which is about 500 kilometres away , through Serbia .
&quot; We have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
In fact , this could lead to a slightly further west route for observers already predic@@ ted postp@@ on@@ ement of the previous Balkan route to Turk@@ ish@@ -@@ <UNK> a-@@ <UNK> a-@@ <UNK> onian Ser@@ bi@@ a-@@ Hungary .
Croatia : &apos; Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive possibilities for border control &apos;
Croatia &apos;s Inter@@ ior Minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
He did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non-@@ Schengen member , has &apos; extensive border control capabilities &apos; .
Stri@@ ct controls are being carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then EU partners have consistently shown good evidence of the standard of border controls .
There are still some 300 refugees on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border f@@ ence .
According to Bel@@ grade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
According to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel further to the Croatian border is still unclear .
The Serbian Inter@@ ior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovi@@ c , tried to re@@ assure Wednesday morning at a local event in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed , to be pre@@ mature .
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment .
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
Hel@@ <UNK> ers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees where alternative routes are drawn by Croatia .
However , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : there are still no clear@@ ed mines in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of Croatia &apos;s war .
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent in the border region .
Stock market h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ ini@@ ans pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have been part of a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having repeatedly gained access to un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wir@@ e , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
In@@ si@@ der transactions in financial markets are to have been made with the information that has been exploited .
In this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than $ 100 million has been spent .
&quot; Today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught &quot; , says the S@@ EC communication .
The proceedings against 32 further accused continued in the case .
Most of the def@@ end@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
The perpet@@ r@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .

The E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Assi@@ stance drew attention to its 20-@@ year existence , and it faces mixed reactions .
&quot; It is about life , so we have gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine L@@ ammer .
The head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Tre@@ at@@ ment Service is available to the Pass@@ enger for questions and talks as well as to the volunte@@ er staff .
While some people spont@@ ane@@ ously attack the circle and read the phrase &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en &quot; , &quot; read &quot; , &quot; with the camp@@ er drive through the US &quot; , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , others stay short , read phr@@ ases like &quot; as far as I am not yet &quot; and then go further .
Again and again , little discussion about the action itself , about life , how to deal with the dying is developing on the fr@@ ing@@ es .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; Only if I make it clear that for me the end of the world comes at some point , I can live respon@@ sibly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian Works Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as Association is the bear@@ er of ec@@ umen@@ ical support .
That is why this public@@ ly-@@ effective action for the 20-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds is good .
However , it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , that this is a very personal matter .
The subject of death and death is still t@@ abo@@ o , according to the experience of Jose@@ fine L@@ ammer , although the liber@@ ation movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to opening up people .
An assessment shared by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
The Star and Tra@@ c@@ tor is one of the volunte@@ ers of the first hour .
By personal experience confronted with the subject , they read a lot of literature and decided to commit themselves to dying .
When the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Assi@@ stance requested by appeal to volunte@@ ers , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id is part of a team of 45 volunte@@ ers - 43 women and two men - who accompany affected and loved ones in private homes , hospitals , nur@@ sing homes and in Ho@@ spi@@ z San@@ kt Vinc@@ ent .
All of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can deal well with her task and experience .
&quot; I see life from another waiting , it seems precious and worth the moment , &quot; she says .
The offer of the am@@ bul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Service is free of charge and subject to change .
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and clubs enables training , training and super@@ visions of the stars and the tru@@ ste@@ es .
Every two years training courses are offered for new employees .
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Protest@@ ant Church ( M@@ 1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
Other personal wishes can also be noted on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex@@ -@@ Res@@ ult mixed , Financial Per@@ spective for 20@@ 16
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x reports disappointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier lower@@ ed its profit marg@@ ins to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service .
The company also said that it plans to mount some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
At this time last year F@@ ed@@ E@@ x announced that the company would like to recru@@ it 50@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
The share fell over 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the fiscal year ending next May , 20 cent less than in previous predic@@ tions .
An@@ alyst@@ s expected $ 10.@@ 84 according to a fac@@ t@@ set survey .
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 % and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher rates for ground transport of heavy and large packages which will be raised from November onwards .
The company said that it still expects the results to increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenue and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said that the company &apos; yiel@@ ds solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade &apos; .
Plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Ri@@ v@@ ale UPS , which plans to recru@@ it 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
In the quarter ending on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
Ear@@ nings per share amoun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share that Z@@ acks Investment Research asked an@@ alyst@@ s to predic@@ t .
Sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
Six out of Z@@ acks asked an@@ alyst@@ s expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ E@@ x has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years , which has brought sales to a stand@@ still in its express shipping unit .
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ E@@ x Gro@@ und .
In the last quarter , sales at ground transport increased by 29 % , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-@@ insurance .
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
In Pre@@ market Trading , about one hour before opening , F@@ ed@@ ex shares fell by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
At its most anticipated session in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 2@@ 7-@@ foot Hon@@ dur@@ as Ma@@ ha@@ g@@ oni@@ -T@@ isch to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade .
Th@@ re@@ ats about them at an end of the decorated two-@@ stor@@ ey session saw a United States wall .
The card is a remin@@ der that the Fed Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices remain stable here .
But , since the Great Rec@@ ession , the Fed has recognized leaders that there is an un@@ broken third mandate : financial stability .
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t , and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be dis@@ cour@@ aged from the unprecedented incentive of near@@ -@@ zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008 .
Although most of the economy ’ s data show that they are growing solid , the recent tur@@ bul@@ ence in global financial markets could fri@@ gh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious Fed officials to reinforce this vol@@ atility by raising interest rates for federal bonds – albeit by a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; Appar@@ ently , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nic@@ ol@@ aus &amp; Co . KG .
&quot; But I think that if they were looking for a pretext not to increase interest rates , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is sufficient justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do about what in@@ sec@@ ts the financial market itself .
About half of the economists recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg predic@@ ted an increase in interest rates this week .
Financial markets , however , expect the Fed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate , unless the strateg@@ ists mitig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed .
On Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average reached 2@@ 28@@ .@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
The action was trig@@ gered by expectations that Fed policy keeps the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to lift the rates at this point , &quot; he said .
If she does , &apos; she would have to go very far in her statement to re@@ assure financial markets so that they do not get into pan@@ ic &apos; .
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would re@@ assure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed to be on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the Liberal complaints that more economic progress would be needed , she expects an increase in the sentence .
Although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
The unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and near the Fed ’ s level of full employment .
E@@ stim@@ ates of wages have shown signs of recovery .
And , while inflation was ste@@ adily below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed officials said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
The economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said I@@ an Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M@@ acro@@ economics .
But financial markets around the world collap@@ sed at the end of last month , after China de@@ valued its currency .
The D@@ ow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors fear@@ ed that a slow@@ down in China ’ s economy would cur@@ b global growth .
The market has recover@@ ed somewhat this month , with the D@@ ow now lying by almost 10 % below the yo@@ ke of May .
For the Fed ’ s representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il affects the complex calculation when interest rates should be raised .
&quot; If events in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would raise the br@@ ink in this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at UC@@ LA <UNK> an Center for Real Estate and a former US Federal Reserve employee .
Now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get better gri@@ ps with the effects .
&quot; There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data descri@@ bing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed ’ s main concerns , so it should not be included technically in its decision-making .
But ultimately , the Fed has become the world ’ s monetary authority .
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years .
The mere reference by the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the Fed could “ narrow ” its monetary expansion trig@@ gered confusion around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , Fed officials can expect to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
Their decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global asset management strategy of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
J@@ eff@@ rey L@@ ack@@ er , Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , this month , said that &quot; the Fed has a history of over@@ reaction to financial market movements that do not appear to be linked to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ ack@@ er , eligible member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to raising interest rates , c@@ ited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
A Asian financial crisis brought the Fed to reduce its bench@@ mark interest rates by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able impact on US growth , &quot; said L@@ ack@@ er .
One year later , the Fed officials re@@ vers@@ ed these cuts .
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England ’ s interest rate fix@@ ing committee .
The recent tur@@ bul@@ ence does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Po@@ sen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be preced@@ ed by time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : Small aid to refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany these days .
To give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunte@@ ers .
There are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support un@@ sel@@ fish <UNK> um-@@ seekers in the city .
They include Pet@@ ra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Pet@@ ra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
She still likes to learn with her 74 lessons .
Every Thursday she does it in the <UNK> um-@@ seekers &apos; home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
It helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo , and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course , teaching is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil ’ s Par@@ di@@ at@@ r@@ ische Gesellschaft Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy bre@@ ast@@ feeding
The Brazilian P@@ edi@@ atri@@ c Organization ( SP@@ RS ) is sho@@ cking to educ@@ ate women about the importance of good nutrition during bre@@ ast@@ feeding , and is doing so with the presentation of pictures of bab@@ ies su@@ cking to bre@@ asts painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
M@@ other milk consists of a variety of prot@@ eins , f@@ ats , vit@@ am@@ ins and car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates that give bab@@ ies all the nutri@@ ents they need to build a strong immune system .
Due to the additional energy requirements , pregn@@ ant women and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily cal@@ ories by about 500 cal@@ ories per day .
However , new research suggests that increased cal@@ orie in@@ take is not the only di@@ etary adjustment that mothers should make .
A recent study led by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medic@@ ine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregn@@ ant women actually affects the genes of their bab@@ ies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
Unfortunately , a child ’ s un@@ healthy diet can ad@@ ver@@ sely affect the immune system .
Exc@@ ep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ese Spor@@ th@@ alle
The municipal council of Bern@@ <UNK> approved the construction application for the 2.@@ 3 million euros expensive sports hall .
And he made an exception .
The roof may become flat for the solar system .
The plans for the long-@@ awa@@ ited tur@@ n-@@ out building at the Bern@@ ese Sport@@ ground are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion .
Pri@@ or to that , the committee had agreed , among other things , a request for a &apos; derog@@ ation &apos; from the applicable construction plan .
The &quot; exception &quot; was about permission for a special form concerning the roof construction .
Thus , a &quot; s@@ add@@ le roof with non-@@ attached first and roof top &quot; is to be built .
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; This will bring us a wonder@@ fully large south roof &quot; , explained may@@ or Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
The &apos; liber@@ ation &apos; was , in turn , about the p@@ av@@ ement which , for energe@@ tic reasons - contrary to what was prescri@@ bed in the construction plan - should be less than ten degrees .
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
A &apos; liber@@ ation &apos; was needed because the construction plan does not allow &apos; exceptions &apos; to the roof , whereas the Bern@@ ese municipal council generally tends to be more restrictive in the case of applications for assistance .
However , the building of Tur@@ n@@ bach is not a recur@@ rent project : &apos; We do not set a precedent &apos; , says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
The building of Tur@@ n@@ bach at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ <UNK> .
Some EUR 2.@@ 3 million have been calculated on costs .
In@@ spec@@ tions are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude sports promotion .
In the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 m large hall will now be submitted to the Agri@@ cultural Office for examination .
Clin@@ ic P@@ ei@@ <UNK> berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
The P@@ ei@@ <UNK> berg Hospital is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - 20@@ 16 .
At the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
The station as well as the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ <UNK> berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
This can be seen from the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , which was confirmed by Land@@ rä@@ tin Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ß .
However , the Supervisory Board will take a decision on this , and it will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
If the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ <UNK> berg would be further employed .
The vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the existing inner station .
The rooms were available .
In Wei@@ l@@ heim , Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ß is supposed to offer a job to employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
The staff were informed of the plans .
The change has dis@@ solved the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clin@@ ic since the beginning of the year , and has now moved to a private practice in a more immediate vicinity of the hospital .
On the question of who the succ@@ ession should take place , according to Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who was willing to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
For the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this in any case means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; Internal Medic@@ ine &quot; , says Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ß .
Fischer is a specialist for car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases at the inner station .
For the next two years , fishermen , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will have both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , is to be closed once and for all in P@@ ei@@ <UNK> berg after nearly 140 years .
Until now , the district had planned this for 20@@ 18 , when the current re@@ medi@@ ation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Jo@@ ch@@ ner Wei@@ ß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , cont@@ acted ru@@ mo@@ urs that the House , which holds the federal government , should in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
As with the real estate , Jo@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Wei@@ ß was unable to say that there are several considerations .
Currently there is a short time care of the car@@ it@@ as and a day@@ esp@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c .
&quot; What better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not arise again , &quot; says Fischer about the qu@@ asi@@ -@@ move to the li@@ ch that was received by the staff &quot; positively and very sympath@@ e@@ tically &quot; .
There has been no real prospect for the House , where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years .
He was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
The P@@ ei@@ <UNK> berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and birth aid .
The Hand@@ b@@ aller of the R@@ hin@@ e-@@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lö@@ wen are called for this evening ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ischen H@@ C .
The Bundes@@ lig@@ a ’ s table leader is the clear favorite in W@@ up@@ per@@ tal , but there is no reason to be over@@ ri@@ dden .
During the last season , the bath@@ ers took a painful defeat at the B@@ H@@ C and got something good there .
Hor@@ se Dar@@ k with Two Lo@@ st at P@@ rat@@ au
Two trac@@ tor drivers were seriously injured by shots during their ma@@ ize harv@@ est on Tuesday afternoon .
During the Aber@@ n@@ tens on a ma@@ ize at P@@ rat@@ au ( Land@@ kreis W@@ itt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unter@@ s were in use , as the police told .
After a shot down , a 6@@ 3@@ - and 2@@ 2-@@ year-old man suffered severe injury and were brought into hospitals .
How exactly the accident could happen was initially unclear .
The criminal police are investig@@ ating .
F@@ ailed 16-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate victims of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-@@ year-old from R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate who has been missing since Saturday .
In dis@@ cour@@ agement , the 20-@@ year-old admitted having killed young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
A 16-@@ year-old from Rhein@@ land-@@ Pf@@ al@@ z , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
The young woman ’ s body was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen near Kais@@ er@@ slau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police comm@@ ented on Wednesday .
A 20-@@ year-old man who was also det@@ ained on Tuesday evening is considered to be susp@@ icious , who , according to the facts , died and the investig@@ ator led to the site of the cor@@ pse .
The 16-@@ year-old was missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of a visit to Ro@@ cken@@ hausen .
In the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ator initially st@@ ole on personal objects of the victim .
In the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances of the missing persons , there has finally been a sus@@ pic@@ ion of the 20-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
The alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Ro@@ cken@@ hausen where the body was found .
According to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police station that killed the 16-@@ year-old and placed the bodies in the channel .
The 20-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be handed over to the prison judge on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators blame him for his death .
Dis@@ c@@ <UNK> on the closer circumstances of the act are to bring about further investigations .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es need accommodation : Stu@@ dy war@@ ns of housing short@@ ages
The location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable stay .
The pressure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The distribution stru@@ gg@@ les in the German housing market have long since begun .
With the incoming refugees and workers from the EU , more and more people are pressing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many major cities .
They compete with low-@@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020 .
This result comes from a study commissioned by the Association of Social H@@ ous@@ ing .
In comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are ready in Germany this year .
There are 14@@ 0@@ ,000 apartments missing .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es are no longer obliged , after the first three months of their stay , to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception .
Many people then enter the housing market and enter into the long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of the rental apartments .
According to the Federal Office of the Federal Republic of Germany , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were rent last year .
However , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees .
The study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in housing policy in recent years .
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year after year .
Currently there have been some 70@@ ,000 homes in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , Matthias Gün@@ ther , author of the study .
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in W@@ G rooms .
Young adults were left un@@ volunt@@ arily in the &quot; Hotel M@@ ama &quot; because of the f@@ lau@@ ts in the housing market .
In the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has dec@@ lined for the first time in recent years .
In order to solve the problem , the &quot; Social housing &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot .
In doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
In this way , the gross value added tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed housing could be suspended for a limited period of time .
In addition , attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation opportunities are needed according to the alliance .
The aid programme for refugees from the K@@ f@@ W State Bank is already well received in towns and communities .
A good week after the start , on Monday evening , EUR 18@@ 4 million had already been ear@@ marked more than half of the EUR 300 million available .
Now the project could even be increased .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es have free rein : Croatia and Slovenia are setting up corrid@@ ors
After Hungary , there is virtually no going through , as more and more refugees choose the route over Croatia .
Zagreb announ@@ ces that it will not be possible to pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
However , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corrid@@ or for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Inter@@ ior Minister , and if it is necessary , we will organise a corrid@@ or , &quot; said the Croatian Inter@@ ior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
After the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the Ser@@ b Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to enter Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border with To@@ var@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had se@@ aled its border for refugees on the previous day .
New legislation , which came into force on the same day , also makes proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
The Croatian Prime Minister , Z@@ or@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovi@@ c , said : &apos; You can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity &apos; .
These people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
However , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police took up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia in the morning .
According to most media reports , Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
They arrived both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border .
On the border between Croatia and Serbia , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
That is why the border strip carries other risks : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ e-@@ dre@@ amer should now quickly create a safe passage .
However , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
On Tuesday , the police told 3@@ 66 people killed .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before Tor@@ closure on Monday it was 9@@ 3@@ 80 .
The new Hungarian laws include over@@ coming and damage to the border f@@ ence as a crime .
In the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated .
The convic@@ ted threatens prison sentences of up to five years and the exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
According to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been received on Tuesday in the &apos; transit sites &apos; newly established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition .
Among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
There would have been 40 refugees there on Wednesday morning .
In practice , however , no one has any prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
In the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &apos; safe third country &apos; .
The rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ port@@ ed there .
Before the &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , few hundred refugees gathered together .
In R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers started to clean up it .
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people have left on the streets in recent weeks .
Sper@@ r@@ g@@ it@@ ter were dismant@@ led and one of the reception camps in the border area was re@@ built .
No one wanted to comment on the objective of this reconstruction .
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria still receives few refugees .
The country has also strengthened its border controls .
The 20@@ ,000 migrants , however , remained in the country after government contributions .
In Salzburg , around 14@@ 00 people are waiting for their way to Germany .
The train journey from Germany to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of German authorities .
In Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot .
May@@ ors dro@@ ve &quot; Gest@@ rand@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; After the bridge festival on Sunday , we were busy cle@@ aring when suddenly ten people were standing with cru@@ ises at the entrance of the t@@ ent &quot; , says W@@ ern@@ stein may@@ or A@@ lo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
Tour@@ ists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
However , because Germany had surpris@@ ingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , it was stopped for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew the str@@ ings together with two other <UNK> ers and their cars across the border into Pass@@ au .
In front of us , we have the un@@ hop@@ ed-@@ for guests first , with j@@ am and drinks .
We said straight away that we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; This was of course for us &quot; , says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
They were very grateful .
A man did not take it to hand over a generous donation - EUR 100 for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; We were very pleased with this , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
On Sunday night in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had swit@@ ched from one ICE to a regional train to Pass@@ au to try to cross the border after the short notice that rail traffic had been stopped to Germany .
However , the regional train was cancelled before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
In W@@ ern@@ stein , the crossing of borders is generally high in the course .
The bridge festival was organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kir@@ chen on Sunday .
The fact that Vi@@ ktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures that guarantee humanity in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian Government into the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
This policy is not just the <UNK> ans who are now facing cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
The p@@ oul@@ try will also have to say that the &apos; promised country &apos; that they invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp .
It will be a great challenge , given the continuing mi@@ grat@@ ory flows and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for protection seekers among us .
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Kon@@ rad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ e-@@ proof qu@@ art@@ ets
Kon@@ rad has all the hands to do with refugee accommodation .
Christian Kon@@ rad is accu@@ stom@@ ed to having his word weight .
The government has appointed the former powerful R@@ ai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
The chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen ’ s first resort has already brought Kon@@ rad under control .
&quot; We have no more hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ chen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
Also , the accommodation of the 20@@ ,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was carried out without a great hur@@ ry , said Kon@@ rad and pra@@ ised the organiz@@ ational &quot; master@@ -@@ performance &quot; .
The Ministry of the Inter@@ ior , on the other hand , spoke of a &apos; crisis situation &apos; .
In total , Kon@@ rad expects a requirement of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ art@@ ets in the last year .
In order to meet the number , there are still 35 000 lo@@ d@@ g@@ ings to be found in the next few weeks - 20@@ ,000 are to be provided by countries , 15@@ ,000 of them are to be found .
If there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; But it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; said Kon@@ rad .
He has already had talks with the national <UNK> men .
These would have assured him that he would also be able to set up centres for the coming refugees .
&quot; In Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferr@@ y Ma@@ ier .
The former V@@ P-@@ Mand@@ atar supports Kon@@ rad .
Tom@@ orrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ din@@ al Christoph Schön@@ born , expl@@ aining how the Church will help .
The asylum coordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the OR@@ F action &quot; Help like us &quot; .
On the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
We also hope for hotels that are empty in winter .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &apos; very high &apos; .
In times of emergency , it is not possible for qu@@ arti@@ ers to keep a certain amount of tow@@ el holders or size of the upper li@@ cks .
For a limited period of time , &apos; emergency standards &apos; would have to apply .
The fact that , contrary to the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior , he is more successful in accommodation is based on Kon@@ rad ’ s experience .
I am an older man , who is not simply told the un@@ truth in the face .
Tr@@ ust is his most important weapon .
Kon@@ rad and Ma@@ ier do not cost the Republic itself .
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
Its own quest for a quarter has not yet been successful .
Kon@@ rad wanted to set up a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
But there are obviously problems with approval .
Linz calls for a better division
The city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as Ti@@ ps Arena and Design Center for Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es Ac@@ comm@@ odation .
This is not necessary at the moment , because the people affected are currently being able to take part without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
In case of emergency , however , other sites should be examined for their availability .
The head of the town critici@@ zes the division of refugees within the federal state .
Other districts must also play their part here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; Lim@@ its are not se@@ aled off &quot;
In a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ <UNK> mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , has been following up on the question of refugees .
Mr Sep@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not being se@@ aled off .
It is still possible for refugees to travel to the Federal Republic of Germany .
However , there are now the relevant border controls .
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
The prot@@ ectors , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
From the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue .
The fact that Austria is now re@@ introducing controls at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger from the actions of the Germans .
The Next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of Time
The reconstruction of the new ship@@ yard in the Lin@@ zer industrial line has been officially completed .
In four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be r@@ ented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; In the IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us &quot; , says S &amp; T bo@@ ss H@@ ann@@ es Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
He could imagine investing in star@@ tu@@ p companies of the New Wer@@ ft and then equi@@ pping them later .
From the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something that Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; The next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a question of time &quot; .
EUR 1.@@ 7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the location , EUR 3.@@ 3 million from the t@@ ech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , Upper Austria and the B@@ und ( FF@@ G ) .
The building has been adapted by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as to T@@ ech@@ center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square met@@ re floor space in the building is already r@@ ented , for another 40 per cent there are requests .
Li@@ a-@@ Per@@ oni@@ -@@ owner opened second business in the Arctic
The new shop focuses on Fur@@ la-@@ Hand@@ bag .
In fact , J@@ ut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to set up a dog .
This project had to hand off the 4@@ 9-@@ year-old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ mark@@ t-@@ Arctic for a short time : after all , she has now grown in the form of another business loc@@ ale .
In the Fur@@ la@@ -Sh@@ op to the store where they sell bags , su@@ it@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , money exchanges are up to 75 euros .
Lar@@ ger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
Several weeks ago it was re@@ built .
&quot; But I have long thought if I should open a shop , &quot; says Br@@ eit .
The decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were also inspired by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; We are the only ones in the large area of Linz selling this brand , &quot; says the mother of two dau@@ gh@@ ters who have their own Italian roots .
Her fashion interest has been put into the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I feel the most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
Why so many women get into trouble when looking at a nice hand@@ bag , the specialist woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
Perhaps it is because a nice bag of any out@@ fit is upgraded .

Whether he speaks <UNK> oph@@ ob@@ ic , concerns journalists , or reveals a lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is pushing the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
And it is doing well .
This is also registered in the picturesque town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
The New Yor@@ ker with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fres@@ ur is a term used by many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the wine road .
Some in the 1@@ 200@@ -@@ resident site is related to him over -@@ zig .
His grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pf@@ al@@ z : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the campaign mode .
The K@@ all@@ stadt Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el shot a movie about Tru@@ mp .
And what do the vill@@ agers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think those who find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , &quot; says Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el .
The native city of London has fil@@ med an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous explo@@ it@@ ers , among which Tru@@ mp also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Hein@@ z .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to speak in &quot; K@@ ings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in K@@ all@@ stadt .
He did not bring it there to the king of the heart .
While there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a mi@@ ghty m@@ au@@ l , &quot; says W@@ end@@ el .
By the way , the nick@@ name &quot; Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high German : the anch@@ or , she says .
So Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the anch@@ or .
The Tru@@ mp ’ s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grand@@ father emi@@ gr@@ ated , and in the US opened a venue for gold gra@@ ves .
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first property purchase in New York .
But the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homes in the long run failed at the Bavarian state , one of which the Pf@@ al@@ z belong@@ ed at the time .
He did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once ab@@ sent without permission , the director of the Institute for P@@ ope History and People ’ s Studies , Rol@@ and Paul , had declared film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &apos; illegal im@@ migrant &apos; .
This is in contrast to what has sometimes been said by the desc@@ end@@ ants .
It has repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; As pol@@ ari@@ zed , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans@@ -@@ Jo@@ ach@@ im Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Hein@@ z &quot; ) .
The win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wers in retirement tend to dis@@ soci@@ ate the Americans , &quot; he is always so bur@@ den@@ some . &quot;
Does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 7@@ 2-@@ year-old .
&quot; He never compl@@ ained about K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; .
The Pen@@ sion@@ ers Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm men@@ tions , as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter mentioned , that a desc@@ endant of the Hein@@ z family don@@ ated something for the church organ during a visit , which generally arrived very well .
&quot; I cannot imagine this from the Donald , &quot; says the 6@@ 8-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
It would be better if he did not dare to vote , because &apos; he has such radical views , I do not know if that is good &apos; .
If those who had spoken in the US at the time of his grand@@ father would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there &quot; .
&quot; There are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ cher Sar@@ ah Büh@@ ler .
And as President ?
&quot; My President is not , &quot; she says .
And : &quot; The gra@@ pes are ri@@ pe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
W@@ end@@ el ’ s film , for which Tru@@ mp has long been inter@@ viewed , has seen 12 000 musicians , including in the United States , aw@@ ak@@ ening interest .
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; .
From the Vice-President ’ s hand at the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 18@@ 00-@@ resident village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
In Austria there are already 20 &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ d@@ ör@@ fer &quot; .
In the neighbouring country , the Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
A &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; can have at most 2@@ 500 inhabitants .
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the ratings , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at today &apos;s show .
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovi@@ c and Lis@@ a Wil@@ k@@ inson go to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals , but there has been no great shi@@ fts in today ’ s assessments .
The breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
The Ri@@ v@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David K@@ och and Sam@@ an@@ th@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , appeared in London as part of a one-@@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
This down@@ side seemed to play no role for Australian TV vie@@ wers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 3@@ 9@@ 7@@ ,000 vie@@ wers in the five capit@@ als , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
Today , a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3@@ ,000 ) , but his figure remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3@@ ,000 ) .
Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
In August today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
At the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40@@ ,000 and 50@@ ,000 .
So far in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 vie@@ wers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 today .
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lis@@ a are in order , thank you for the review !

The great news for Seven was the impressive de@@ but of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Eri@@ k Th@@ om@@ son .
The new drama about a recently passed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million vie@@ wers .
Cri@@ tics wonder@@ ed if Th@@ om@@ son could wear a heat show Sol@@ o without the Raf@@ ters Star Reb@@ ec@@ ca Gi@@ b@@ ney .
The outcome of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes &apos; .
The X@@ -F@@ actor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 13@@ 6 million vie@@ wers and easily beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.@@ 000 ) and T@@ B@@ L Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 2@@ 6.@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
The first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new Qu@@ iz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe erg@@ ab on average 4@@ 4@@ 6@@ ,000 spec@@ t@@ ators .
The second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ ump@@ ed to 6@@ 23.@@ 000 spec@@ t@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot@@ -S@@ eat ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
On Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20@@ ,000 spec@@ t@@ ators and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20@@ ,000 .
Hot@@ -S@@ eat on average 6@@ 20@@ ,000 .
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot@@ -@@ eat will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
The Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that did not succeed in su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

The last three agree : B@@ achel@@ or S@@ am W@@ ood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
Sec@@ ret revealed ? ...
Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows , Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay , and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski may seem ignor@@ ant who wins The B@@ achel@@ or .
The woman , where S@@ am W@@ ood finally land@@ ed in The B@@ achel@@ or , was en@@ tic@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the one who received the last rose .
But when we checked in with Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski and Lan@@ a Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three become two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
S@@ am W@@ ood keeps his li@@ ps se@@ aled until the final on Thursday .
All three women , in a ly@@ ri@@ cal way , abandoned why W@@ ood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be their partner .
However , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; , their answers could become the dealer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ o@@ ski quickly called M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for W@@ ood .
Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ am W@@ ood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; From the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ah ) and S@@ ams energies , because I felt they were fairly compatible , and I thought this throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on@@ s-@@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sar@@ ah stands on both feet on the earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ o@@ ski added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chem@@ istry .
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and S@@ am W@@ ood are well suited as a couple .
From her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit to the house made her clear that W@@ ood could be the One .
&quot; As soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly put on him , &quot; she said .
And when she was asked who W@@ ood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lan@@ a .
The B@@ achel@@ or will be broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ F@@ L career .
Det@@ ro@@ it and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
But Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 4@@ 9@@ ers and coach J@@ im Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
Some train@@ ers would have banned Hay@@ ne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a bar@@ rel as the Aus@@ si@@ e-@@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ter did at his first pun@@ t-@@ return on Tuesday at the 20-@@ 3 victory against M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota .
But Tom@@ s@@ ula tru@@ sted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t-@@ return and also to the ongoing game after a injury of Reg@@ g@@ ie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dres@@ sing cabin after the game .
Instead of sh@@ ou@@ ting his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he stopped them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the match .
The 4@@ 9@@ ers sports re@@ porter C@@ am In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who told him to forget his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is a p@@ unt that has been restored by the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ k@@ ings in the first quarter of the game .
It was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ac@@ complic@@ ity had hoped for his N@@ F@@ L de@@ but .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end and later told the Australian Radio Du@@ o Ham@@ ish &amp; An@@ dy at 2@@ Day@@ F@@ M 10@@ 4.@@ 1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his N@@ F@@ L career .
&quot; This was a thing that comes before , one takes care only of the next game , and that is , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his de@@ but in 2007 , when a pass in his own in-@@ Go@@ al area led to a try for Que@@ ens@@ land .
However , it was a great experience for the 2@@ 7-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
Hay@@ ne presented for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his inst@@ ag@@ ram .

Free voters are calling for 1000 new teachers to be recru@@ ited in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
Party and group leader Hu@@ bert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned of a severe crisis in Bay@@ ern@@ s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn school in Gross@@ wall@@ stadt , when there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; Otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
The land fra@@ ction of the free elec@@ torate meets in the underground comm@@ une until Friday .
In fact , quite different main topics were planned .
But the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free El@@ ection Meeting .
&quot; Of course , the topic of asylum will out@@ source the cl@@ ergy , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; This is not going on , we need to address the causes , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ <UNK> Chairman .
Ref@@ l@@ ected asylum seekers want to postp@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
That is why Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases : &apos; We need at least 50 new asylum judges &apos; , said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
The F@@ W bo@@ ss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &apos; We need uniform standards across the federal states &apos; .
&quot; Bavaria shi@@ fts away , others do not . &quot;
&apos;@@ We need to be more effective in this respect &apos; .
But national politics in the city of Great Wall should not fall below the table .
A long-@@ standing bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : education policy .
For the new school year , V@@ oc@@ ational Minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , at 47 G@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , has launched the pilot experiment &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; , which will test an extension of the g@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um from three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to finish .
But Ai@@ w@@ anger does not go far enough .
&quot; The issue of G@@ 9 needs to be spe@@ eded up , &quot; said the F@@ W-@@ bo@@ ss .
We call for freedom of choice for all schools that want this .
Free driving at G@@ 9 anywhere where it is desired .
Fes@@ tere Wall Street helps Da@@ x on the j@@ umps
The German stock market has closed with profits after a non-@@ align@@ ed and ner@@ vous trading period of more than a long distance .
It was only in the afternoon that a more solid start of the US tro@@ phi@@ es provided a clear direction that eventually led the Da@@ x to the top by 0.@@ 56 % to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
The M@@ Da@@ x mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 5@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
The techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ based T@@ ec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
The Euro@@ Sto@@ x@@ x 50 as the eurozone ’ s cor@@ p@@ us index was down by 1.@@ 01 % to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
Soli@@ d profits also bu@@ ys the trading fees in London and Paris .
In the US , the D@@ ow-@@ Jon@@ es index last reported about 1 percent in the Plus .
Many stock exchanges expect markets to take place on this Friday , even after interest rates have been decided in the US , and also as a major default on the fut@@ ures exchange .
In the meantime , the debate on the cost of the nuclear exit has pushed R@@ WE ’ s shares to a record low , and has also left deep traces at E@@ on .
According to &quot; mir@@ rors &quot; , the German energy companies may lack EUR 30 billion in reserves .
The Federal Government de@@ duc@@ ted the figures mentioned in the press .
The shares of the two largest German energy groups recover@@ ed somewhat , but eventually lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infineon ’ s shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ X peak .
According to a tra@@ der , a positive report by the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; came from the weekend .
As a result , investors are currently paying too little attention to the German Chi@@ p@@ bauer .
The investment in forwar@@ d-@@ looking w@@ af@@ er technologies and the focus on the automotive industry should pay off .
Auto@@ values were asked : Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were taken off again than in the previous year , as the industry association Ac@@ ea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
The documents of the Daim@@ ler and BMW cars amoun@@ ted to 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen benefits increased by 1.@@ 26 % .
On the German pension market , the chan@@ ge-@@ rate return of listed federal securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
The pension index R@@ ex rose by 0.@@ 12 % to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
The Bund@@ -F@@ ut@@ ure lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
The price of the euro fell in the afternoon to last $ 1.@@ 12@@ 62 .
At mid@@ day , the European Central Bank set the reference rate at USD 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( USD 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) .
The dollar thus cost EUR 0.@@ 8@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 8@@ 8@@ 75 ) .
4 people killed after police sla@@ ves shot at demonstr@@ ators in Nepal .
Four people , including a four-@@ year-old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rub@@ b@@ ish into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a civil serv@@ ant on Wednesday .
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ man@@ du .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u P@@ ras@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , district govern@@ or , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of you waiting for stones and fire bom@@ bs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police used c@@ ran@@ es and then shot into the air before taking them back on rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bo@@ ots used , which are known to be able to kill them , but which are traditionally used as a less le@@ th@@ al alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
The conflict was the last weeks of violent protests in Nepal ’ s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say that new provin@@ ces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provin@@ ces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but legislat@@ ors acceler@@ ated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
The legislat@@ ors voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kath@@ man@@ du , and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
Con@@ struction area planned in the city
The property at the Em@@ der Youth Centre Al@@ te Post is to be re@@ built .
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 400@@ 0-@@ square met@@ re area .
There is a mixture of trade , commerce and housing - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a 4@@ ,000 square met@@ re estate in the immediate vicinity of the Youth Centre Al@@ te Post .
Pre@@ par@@ ations are under way .
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
You are waiting for appropriate offers , it is stated on the part of the city .
Which investor comes into question is not yet clear .
Accordingly , no contracts have yet been concluded .
The city of Em@@ den had already bought part of the plot on the ring road / corner of Great Street a few months ago and left the building lying on it .
H@@ ieve project : Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday settlement on the Kl@@ einen Sea near Em@@ den are taking shape .
For the first time , the investor made public plans for the project .
Several pil@@ ots are still concerned - they fear the sale of their pas@@ sports .
Mon@@ at@@ el@@ ang had been negotiated , gr@@ asp@@ ed , debated and drawn behind closed doors .
Now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
On Monday evening , the Inter@@ est , the SM@@ E Em@@ der Enterprise &quot; System@@ -B@@ au &quot; , presented its plans publicly in the Em@@ der Council &apos;s Committee on Ur@@ ban Development for the first time .
Origin@@ ally , this item was on the non-@@ public part of the agenda .
Under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , who accused investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , R@@ al@@ f B@@ ehr@@ ends went from the system management to the offensive : &quot; We have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
But it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
The EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Real reactions among land@@ l@@ ords who had come to the meeting highlighted the pictures and new details of the hotel building they wanted to see .
Rober@@ to Schulz , land@@ l@@ ord owner and member of the board of directors compl@@ ained about the interests of the att@@ or@@ ney , Pro H@@ ieve : &quot; This is a gigan@@ tic cl@@ oud that sur@@ prises all other bodies &quot; .
In addition , he fears , like a number of other project critics , that transport would rise sharp@@ ly through the planned size of the plant : &apos; There must be full bus loading so that this is calculated &apos; , says Schulz .
However , what is happening exactly in the middle of a h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
There is still no operator .
&quot; Only then must we have a coherent concept , &quot; said R@@ al@@ f B@@ ehr@@ ends .
Because this has not yet been done , the construction plans are still variable .

Google is launching a double fund@@ raising campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees .
Google Inc ( G@@ O@@ OG@@ L . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donor campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations because they are fle@@ eing war@@ -@@ tor@@ n and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusual personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement , R@@ ita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fle@@ w with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; Our journey included many dark train and bus jour@@ neys , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
But , as the refugee and mi@@ grat@@ ory crisis has grown in Europe , many people , like my family , are desper@@ ately looking for help .
The donations go to four char@@ itable organizations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors without fron@@ tiers , International Res@@ cu@@ e Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations collected will be doub@@ led to $ 11 million worth of 5.@@ 5 million on goo@@ g@@ le@@ .com / <UNK> er@@ el@@ ief .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four-@@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

Wei@@ ght loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight di@@ ab@@ e@@ tics .
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight patients with type 2 di@@ abetes may take at least five years after a new study .
It is still too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with di@@ abetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ sur@@ g@@ ical treatments .
&quot; The mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a edi@@ torial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
Wei@@ ght loss operations or o@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stom@@ ach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body ’ s own ability to absor@@ b food .
Over the years , o@@ bes@@ ity operations for the treatment of type 2 di@@ abetes have proved effective , but most studies have been carried out in humans who are sick o@@ bes@@ e with a bo@@ dy mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
A BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be o@@ bes@@ e .
You can calcul@@ ate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
For the new study , the researchers from Taiwan ’ s Min@@ -Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a study compar@@ ing two types of A@@ di@@ posi@@ t@@ as surgery - stom@@ ach b@@ yp@@ ass and stom@@ ach cle@@ ans@@ ing - to medical treatments for type 2 di@@ abetes among people who were slightly over@@ weight .
The average BM@@ I among those under@@ going this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
In the meantime , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non-@@ sur@@ g@@ ical di@@ abetes treatments approximately at the same time as 29 .
Among those who under@@ go surgery , 36 % of the di@@ abetes dis@@ orders were completely eliminated and 28 % were partially eliminated .
In the medi@@ cal@@ -@@ treated group , di@@ abetes was completely only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
In addition , the results of the blood pressure controls , the tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; in general better in the &apos; sur@@ g@@ ical &apos; group , were published by the authors .
Res@@ ear@@ chers were also monitoring the patient blood flow levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflected blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 % , the researchers write .
After the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 % to around 6 % .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 % .
But this better &quot; gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , according to the chief resear@@ cher Dr. Chi@@ h-@@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
In the fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass@@ -@@ Chi@@ r@@ ur@@ gi@@ e-@@ Group had lost more weight in comparison with the Gast@@ re@@ k@@ tom@@ y Group ( 18.@@ 7 v@@ s. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached greater falls in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 against 5.@@ 1 ) and hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % v@@ s. 2.1 % ) , and more recently recorded a complete over@@ dose of the total .
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Ari@@ zona , College of Medic@@ ine Pho@@ enix .
In the Swedish study , it was about 29 % less likely to die over 15 years of o@@ bes@@ ity , compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
Although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of sur@@ g@@ ical patients , Black@@ stone said that it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group &quot; , without increased risk of death or kid@@ ney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long to bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that as soon as they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes , which have bound their bodies with o@@ bes@@ ity and di@@ abetes , re@@ versal is really difficult . &apos;
Love History plays in H@@ uns@@ rü@@ ck
It is a subject that is increasingly being taken into account in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ popular at school , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she lo@@ ves in her .
Also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ is@@ a Bin@@ der .
In addition to the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rü@@ ck readers , because it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - R@@ T-@@ News
Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies .
The Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
The Dalai Lama raised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-@@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ as@@ sion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents in the circumstances .
He also stressed that , while the Western European countries ’ response to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama pra@@ ised Germany ’ s and Austria ’ s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
Ultim@@ ately , we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries .
We need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; The use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of violence and comm@@ ented on George Bush ’ s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and pointed out that the US ’ s violent response was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
After 11 September , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non-@@ violence .
&quot; I know his mo@@ tives were good , but he introduced violence , and this has led to unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
Four@@ -@@ fold increase in children ’ s use of child suspension dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants over the last 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ control centers in the US report a nearly 400@@ -@@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who s@@ wal@@ low heavily alcoho@@ lic hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , according to the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
According to Dr. G@@ ay@@ l@@ ord L@@ op@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand@@ dis@@ infection among children under 12 years of age reporting toxic control centers rose from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 1@@ 17 in 2014 .
&quot; Children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez CN@@ N .
He said that some children drinking dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or to sample social media mut@@ u@@ ality .
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
Young people have alle@@ ge@@ dly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol and mouth water to obtain a harder drink .
Rec@@ ent children can be attracted by attractive fra@@ gr@@ ances of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; One child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said L@@ op@@ ez .
Many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ ected .
There are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries , gra@@ pes and or@@ an@@ ges , which are very appealing to children .
Hän@@ de@@ des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 % alcohol .
Especially for inf@@ ants , few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
&quot; It is highly concentrated alcohol &quot; , told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ f@@ tn@@ ot@@ Call Center in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ <UNK> City .
So you would not let wh@@ is@@ ky lie around , but people leave these hand@@ s-@@ on dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consu@@ me much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah Rus@@ sell , a six-@@ year-old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ries of du@@ sty hang@@ ing dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought to an emergency treatment .
Their blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered to be dr@@ unk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ <UNK> ett Medical Center outside Atlan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah l@@ all@@ te their words and was unable to go when they arrived in the emergency .
Doc@@ tors wat@@ ched them overnight in a separate children ’ s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had b@@ lown his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; This was very fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ ij@@ ah@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
It could have been fat@@ al for my child .
L@@ op@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-@@ alcoho@@ lic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store h@@ andi@@ cap@@ s outside the reach of the child .
In addition to alcohol po@@ is@@ oning , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were fat@@ alities .
In 2013 , two women in On@@ t@@ ario died after the rav@@ ages of h@@ andi@@ cap@@ s containing a toxic , un@@ declared ing@@ re@@ dient .
Health officials suspect that the product contained me@@ than@@ ol , a de@@ adly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ing@@ re@@ dient .
In January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to po@@ ison their &quot; native &quot; teacher by presenting anti@@ bacter@@ ial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
The teacher is highly all@@ erg@@ ic to hang@@ ing dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and she hi@@ jack@@ ed them from her room .
The police considered the ins@@ ul@@ ting plan to be &apos; s@@ cour@@ ge &apos; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authority .
Vil@@ lin@@ gen-@@ Sch@@ <UNK> ingen : Three vehicles damaged

A 6@@ 0-@@ year-old lor@@ ry driver went on the cross section towards the round@@ about industrial area and was too late to see that at the round@@ about two vehicles had stopped driving ahead .
As a result , he went into the h@@ eck of an audit with his truck and shot this vehicle on a Ford Fi@@ esta before .
The vehicles involved in the accident caused material damage of around EUR 10 000 , the police reported .

I do not think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ ing Dutch - de Bo@@ er
The former R@@ anger@@ s-@@ mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ field player and former Dutch national player Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ <UNK> .
De Bo@@ er , currently an amb@@ ass@@ ador for A@@ j@@ ax , said : &quot; In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Cel@@ tics games and why ? &quot;
It is because the ra@@ ids are not there .
People here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ <UNK> .
You are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
They talk about both teams together and what they are interested in .
There is a lot of tension in the Ol@@ d-@@ Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ at D@@ ei@@ la .
RO@@ N@@ Y D@@ ei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norweg@@ ian bo@@ ss swe@@ ars to turn things around .
After the defeat of Mal@@ <UNK> and the subsequent departure from the Champ@@ ions League , the defeat of 10 men from Aber@@ de@@ en , who now stand at the top of the table with five points .
But D@@ ei@@ la said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
Now we want to get out there as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very an@@ gr@@ y or sad about what happens .
We feel exactly that - but we must go on .
We really need the support of Cel@@ tic because it makes the player better .
Com@@ ing together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously for <UNK> ar-@@ transfers

The ex-@@ bo@@ ss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; The January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
The players who come in the summer have this pre-@@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
The team is really good .
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

Un@@ employment in Scotland remains un@@ changed , while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole .
Un@@ employment in Scotland remained un@@ changed between May and July at 16@@ 4@@ ,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million over the same period .
Latvia ’ s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 % was above that of the UK of 5.@@ 5 % , as the figures from the National St@@ atis@@ tics Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
In the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 % over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 % .
The Secretary of State for Scotland David M@@ und@@ ell comm@@ ented on the latest figures and said : &apos; The government ’ s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy &apos; .
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
In these 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market , with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment .

Why I will witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
Some@@ thing later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
If it happens , and I hope it does not happen , I will be sitting in a spec@@ t@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the tox@@ in .
He asked me to be one of the four official witn@@ esses to his death .
The invitation was first made in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I voted .
When the day came closer , I began to fear .
So why should I do it ?
I voted because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
It is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since there are often more applications available than seats , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to 5 .
Anyone who is selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hour visit .
I like the guy .
We often lau@@ gh a lot when we speak .
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
A journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
Here is the lesson .
T@@ ell the story of the pris@@ oner how he wants it , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ain to her .
She acknowledged that she could have put it better , but she still thinks it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
He does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he did .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witn@@ esses at any time .
But he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
When he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I do not want to go into all the details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
His actions , following the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese , would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of fact .
But I believe that there is a strong prob@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
And from this perspective , I shall see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other re@@ por@@ ters you can turn to .
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
A man who passes to hum@@ id police persecution j@@ ag@@ d to get out of the Cann@@ ing River .
The Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he over@@ thre@@ w the man from the Cann@@ ing River .

The police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday for a hom@@ e-@@ bre@@ ast@@ feeding incident in B@@ eck@@ enha@@ m .
When they discovered the susp@@ ects , they tried to escape to Cann@@ ing River .
But he did not come too far .
&quot; He stood in the water and said &apos; I do not come out , com@@ m and ho@@ l me &apos; , said Senior Ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Con@@ stable L@@ ach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ v@@ ec was not exc@@ ited to make his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tics - &quot; A good polic@@ em@@ an negoti@@ ates &quot; .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ y him and threatened to stop racing .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
He focused on the Ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ al Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself in difficult conditions when it was about the positive K@@ ob@@ alt sam@@ pling at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
He had held himself for 18 months because of the charges of sp@@ ying and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hang@@ ing gra@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
You know that progress has been made .
Sometimes one re@@ acts , and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home this evening and sleep well .
I would like to go around the main issue , and I would like my owners to think that I try my best for them .
If they begin to think I do not do so , then I should not be more tra@@ iner .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
Pre@@ <UNK> , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to sp@@ y his st@@ ables .
&quot; Ei@@ gh@@ teen months ago Terr@@ y Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Bri@@ an Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com.
They seem to believe that I am a frau@@ d@@ ster .
If that is the case , they should certainly take their nose because they have failed in trying to summ@@ arise me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ ston , Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President-in-Office of R@@ V@@ L and Bern@@ ard Sa@@ <UNK> , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today .
Should this lead me to believe that it will become a personal matter ?
Did the R@@ V@@ L beh@@ ave co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps people outside train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
Are I bad for the industry ?
Are I so bad for the industry ?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am it .
Perhaps they have to take my license and infrin@@ ge me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying now makes them think about it .
But I have now arrived at the point at which I do not care , and that makes me sad .
That makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to take a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
The train@@ ers ’ fru@@ stration levels have been built up with the long-@@ lasting K@@ ob@@ alt investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to say that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ broken master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mu@@ d or cla@@ y had been put on the hor@@ seb@@ ack , which was contrary to the rules .
&quot; It is against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for this , &apos; he said .
&quot; One of my staff was mist@@ ak@@ en@@ ly wearing mu@@ d on the leg .
It could have been so last night .
It could have been the whole day , as was the case .
But it also had it so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three-@@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day .
It is a jo@@ ke .
People who impose these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; We all recognise that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .

Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y goes back to Ri@@ v@@ alen for alleg@@ ations of ring stru@@ gg@@ les .
Mel@@ bour@@ ne Stor@@ m coach Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has critici@@ zed the T@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Ag@@ da@@ -S@@ et@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson said that the refer@@ ee allowed Stor@@ m players &quot; ring battle &quot; with his team during the high stor@@ m victory in the quali@@ fying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
B@@ ris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos tra@@ iner W@@ ay@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hardly dis@@ gu@@ ised comment about the Stor@@ m team after his team had reached the final match against North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys on Saturday night .
Bell@@ am@@ y defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said that when T@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing , they were focused only on their &quot; contact &quot; .
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers at his team tru@@ sts him because it meant that they were worried about being be@@ aten by the Stor@@ m team .
&quot; This is repeated time and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Rob@@ inson talked about ring stru@@ gg@@ les when they beat us 24 : 2 &quot; , said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with T@@ ac@@ kl@@ es a real priority , and this has led to a change of direction for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train , so he is probably not accu@@ stom@@ ed to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
It is already com@@ ic , as it always appears in this season .
Bell@@ am@@ y attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ g@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; bor@@ ing &quot; football .
W@@ ay@@ ne talks about exciting football .
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a bor@@ ing team , and W@@ ay@@ ne said that he would take care of a di@@ vor@@ ce .
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player .
He made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anth@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so that they can play like these .
I build greater confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about having to play against us .
Six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Stor@@ m against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against C@@ ow@@ boys .
The game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
Or are breaks and not points a bit more exciting ?
For me , these are the timet@@ ables .
When they mention us , it means that we will meet them at a stage .
The Stor@@ m team has been free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ ark@@ s on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with $ 200@@ ,000 b@@ ail for drug use .
A man who may be threatening a life-@@ long punishment for his attempt to acquire 40 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ gg@@ led to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200@@ ,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America over Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co-@@ accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 ki@@ lo@@ gram@@ s of the drug in a To@@ y@@ ota Ech@@ o .
Despite a potentially life-@@ long punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic ’ s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to hold the whole crowd and that the caf@@ e could have been for a harm@@ less reason .
The judge of the Supreme Court , Peter F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
He has clear relations with Serbia .
He often goes to Serbia , &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday .
In the criminal case , he lied to the police about his wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic ’ s mother and grand@@ father had offered a b@@ ail of $ 200@@ ,000 together to secure his release .
&quot; After reading the statements by the two persons , it is clear that the requirement for a security of $ 200@@ ,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; Ju@@ dge F@@ lan@@ ag@@ an said .
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he hand@@ les his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and maintains an initial lock of 18 : 00-@@ 06 : 00 .
In@@ jur@@ ies to A@@ 5 in Karlsruhe : Le@@ ader expert dis@@ covers
A lor@@ ry driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday night when a road accident involving three lor@@ ries on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
Two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ced ahead of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in v@@ ain to move to the left at the last moment , as the police told .
The leader of the accident cause was completely apart .
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
The A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and <UNK> ru@@ h@@ e-@@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 pm .
There has been a damage of EUR 12@@ 2@@ ,000 .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone of girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les to send pictures .
A pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this <UNK> f log@@ ged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of uns@@ ur@@ passed images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl wat@@ ched later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
She saw it , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ zed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research that used terms to search for un@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to officials that he had done so , because it would lead to &apos; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les on the Internet &apos; , and then he pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ em@@ an to fri@@ gh@@ ten them &apos; .
The prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he was ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ gh@@ tening people .
He admitted that the se@@ arches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ em@@ an to fri@@ gh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les .
He was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
He said that he did it to praise them .
He said he was sick in the head when he dro@@ w@@ ned , and he said he wanted to see pictures of rap@@ e and murder .
Ms Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; When the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the lem@@ on and on the wine .
She then also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and <UNK> ed the def@@ endant with it .
The girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who saw much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , was guilty , in the sense of the indic@@ t@@ ment , of having received un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , of viol@@ ating the conditions on 25 January of this year and not being brought to trial for a hearing on 24 March this year .
Def@@ ense lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because it could be argued that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; should be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ sta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael for@@ bid the ver@@ dict until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a deposit in this case , but was held in cust@@ ody for hear@@ ings on other outstanding cases .
It was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
Bad users switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany .
More and more refugees are being taken up off the major control points on the German-@@ Austrian border .
Many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , fear@@ ful of discovery and arrest , left people more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , said a spo@@ kes@@ man of the Bundes@@ <UNK> .
Along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the regions of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal@@ -@@ Inn since Tuesday .
They came to the German side on foot via bridges and dam@@ s .
They are received by federal police officers and forwar@@ ded to registration .
At Munich ’ s main railway station , federal police data reported that there were more refugees than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday .
By 8@@ .00 p.m. alone , around 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a speaker in the morning .
Following the re@@ introduction of controls at the Fran@@ co-@@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : Aus@@ sen@@ fer von Tro@@ p@@ enst@@ ur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; awaits you in the sou@@ thwest .
Met@@ e@@ or@@ ologists war@@ n of stor@@ ms in the sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe current warm sea air into the country , the German We@@ ather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) reported in Stuttgart .
The powerful temple is the ancest@@ or of the &quot; Henry &quot; Tro@@ p@@ enst@@ ur@@ m , which has been dra@@ g@@ ged by the Ber@@ mu@@ da Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
He@@ al@@ thy stor@@ ms and th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are mainly expected in bathing .
According to D@@ W@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the So@@ il Cir@@ cu@@ it , so@@ ils from 60 to 90 kilometres are still to be expected by Thursday morning .
So , on Friday , the sun can look longer .
The mass makes &apos; s : every two years , the car walls on the IA@@ A show their no@@ vel@@ ties .
In 2015 , in particular , there is a movement in the compact cars that are currently selling themselves particularly well .
Car@@ s from the compact class are currently in particular demand : approximately 28@@ .@@ 1 percent of the new car models were in this segment only in August , according to the Motor V@@ eh@@ ic@@ le Federal Office ( K@@ BA ) .
This is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
Between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and Lux@@ ury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
The Op@@ el A@@ stra , which will be with dealers in the autumn , is one of the biggest car companies for the German automotive industry .
&quot; The A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Op@@ el bo@@ ss Kar@@ l-@@ Thomas Ne@@ um@@ ann at the fair .
It is part of the core of the brand .
In order for the volume model to be sold well , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive .
Op@@ el offers a gli@@ mp@@ se below the largest competi@@ tor V@@ W Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
The current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
The A@@ stra is equipped with a new 1.@@ 4-@@ li@@ ter engine with 74 kW / 100 h@@ p .
In addition , the H@@ essen offers further diesel and pet@@ rol engines from 70 kW / 95 h@@ p up to 14@@ 7 kW / 200 h@@ p , including for the first time three-@@ cy@@ linder tra@@ ilers .
Unlike the main competitors V@@ W Golf and Ford Focus , Op@@ el A@@ stra is only five miles away .
As a second vari@@ ant , the Com@@ bi will follow in spring , which is already on the IA@@ A .
And what will be done next to the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A on new compact disc@@ s ?
Ren@@ ault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Ren@@ ault sends the fourth generation of his A@@ stra@@ -@@ ri@@ val Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
At the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only seen as a fifth in a conventional and an empha@@ sized spor@@ ty version of the G@@ T .
He comes into trade at the beginning of next year , then as a com@@ bi .
<UNK> iti : All new in the segment is the <UNK> iti Q@@ 30 .
The N@@ iss@@ an boom wants to find its position in the fast@@ -@@ growing segment with the new model .
The compact <UNK> iti fits fully into the brand ’ s design line with its cur@@ ved lines .
The basic model will get a gas@@ ol@@ ine engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 12@@ 2 h@@ p .
However , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 10@@ 9 h@@ p or 125 kW / 170 h@@ p .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : New in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celeb@@ rates his world premi@@ ere in Frankfurt .
Off@@ ers will be the model with pet@@ rol engines , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0-@@ li@@ ter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 1@@ 11 h@@ p .
The maximum tor@@ que is 170 New@@ ton@@ met@@ ers ( N@@ m ) according to manufacturer specifications .
Sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 20@@ 16 .
DS 4 : Not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen on the IA@@ A .
In addition , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n fe@@ eder placed their hands on the front side : here the refriger@@ ator gri@@ ll was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
In the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a tou@@ ch@@ screen and integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
In addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new vari@@ ants on the IA@@ A in the compact class , such as the Merc@@ edes A class or the P@@ eu@@ ge@@ ot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin@@ -T@@ egel : Five square met@@ re cell are un@@ worthy .
The Federal Constitutional Court has granted the right to an ex-@@ pris@@ oner of the Ju@@ di@@ cial Off@@ ices T@@ egel , who has been hous@@ ed in too small a cell for months .
Due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are hous@@ ed in small cells .
This decision was taken by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
According to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were impris@@ oned only a few days in the narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 12@@ 7 / 14 ) .
As a result , an ex-@@ pris@@ oner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was hous@@ ed in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space in the Berlin@@ -T@@ egel , which was completed between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated in spati@@ al terms .
After that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now back on his free feet had been moved into a larger cell .
His court of responsibility for the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed .
But the Constitutional Court ordered the ruling of the K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ an Court in Berlin and returned the case for re-@@ examination .
They see the human dignity of the man violated .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now decides on the level of compensation
Even though , for legal reasons , only a few days &apos; impris@@ onment for compensation was decisive for the period in question , there was a right of compensation .
Otherwise , &apos; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be fear@@ ed &apos; .
K@@ amm@@ erg@@ eri@@ cht now needs to clarify the level of damage to money .
In the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
Thus , only in April , they told a pris@@ oner compensation because he was locked in a cell n@@ aked .
According to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also un@@ worthy of human dignity .
In addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which , in a parallel case in November 2009 , had certified an un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied accommodation to a pris@@ oner .
The former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was hous@@ ed in a similar cell between 15 and 21 hours a day over three months , as in the Soviet case .
In recent weeks , the pris@@ ons of Berlin have also come to the head@@ lines because of a lack of staff .
That is why prisoners are repeatedly impris@@ oned for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even if they are to be ra@@ zed because of the ten@@ se situation .
According to the judicial black@@ mail , 21 posts in T@@ egel are not occupied because of lack of young people , 19 are to fall out in 20@@ 16 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &apos; We are creating this &apos;
Im@@ migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What comes to Germany ?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the Federal Ministry of the Inter@@ ior , according to <UNK> Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabri@@ el ( SP@@ D ) , Germany is even able to receive one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we create it . &quot;
What is to be done in Germany provides the following overview .
According to different proj@@ ections between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - for the next five years .
This is almost twice as much as before ( 25@@ 0@@ ,000 apartments ) .
However , the lack of housing is dramatic , especially in the case of affordable rental properties : between 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 homes every year fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favor@@ able housing will also apply to refugees .
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture , Barbar@@ a H@@ end@@ ri@@ cks ( SP@@ D ) , wants to double the funding , from currently EUR 5@@ 18 million to EUR 1 billion .
That is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ lag@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be created annually , and it would be worth investing 6.@@ 4 billion per year in support of it .
<UNK> sts and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
It is estimated that , in the long run , 55 percent of p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be employed by the Institute for Employment and V@@ oc@@ ational Research .
However , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critici@@ zes Clau@@ dia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Ber@@ tel@@ sm@@ ann Foundation .
However , the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contacts , to the appreciation of the host society , but also to the self-@@ est@@ e@@ em of immigrants , says Migration for@@ scher Di@@ et@@ rich Th@@ orn@@ hardt .
In Germany , there has been a political turn@@ around , according to Th@@ orn@@ ton : the ban on refugees working for recognition of work .
While there was a ban on asylum seekers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as was the duty of residence to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence .
In society , and also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the majority of people have taken the view that refugees should be given access to the labour market more quickly .
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
So far there is no adequate offer of general and occup@@ ational language courses .
Research also shows that jobs are most frequently communic@@ ated through personal contacts .
The creation of networks , therefore , is the Royal Way of Labour Integration , according to Th@@ orn@@ hardt .
The Berlin school administration has found that few fle@@ eing parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated to be ten to 15 percent : &quot; It is important for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents to keep the family together &quot; , says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Sen@@ ate administration .
However , in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management hand@@ les distributed in different languages .
If the demand for educ@@ ators increases greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Sen@@ ate would try to increase the educational capacity , for example by allowing more vocational schools .
In the countries , students are prepared for teaching without German language skills in welcome classes .
However , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but also , as in Berlin , by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
There is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers of the Berlin School Administration .
The German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 % of refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or commem@@ or@@ ates studies - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
Stu@@ dent refugees could be made easier to access the university .
Ref@@ u@@ ge@@ es with a den@@ ial of residence or tolerance no longer receive services under the Asyl@@ um Eff@@ ici@@ ency Act if they start studying .
In principle , the latter do not get a bas@@ ket because they do not fall within the circle of the legally entitled persons .
Pre@@ <UNK> refugees have had to live in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 20@@ 16 , this gap has fallen to 15 months .
However , this funding gap also needs to be closed , require St@@ eff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin ’ s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Student@@ en@@ werk .
Stu@@ dents should immediately get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as the churches , and develop the existing state church right to a new state religious relationship .
It would also be important to set up an Islamic char@@ ity organisation that looks after new@@ com@@ ers profession@@ ally .
The rights also include duties .
In this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact points and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain means of control .
This also involves the willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
On Thursday , the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be recorded in Germany .
Those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to exist here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bavarian radio .
He proposed transl@@ ating the constitution into Arab@@ ic .
Integration will , in future , be much more than today , an issue for society as a whole .
This will also have to change the majority society , and the elimination of discrimination and racism will be more pressing .
Although Germany has , as a result of European decisions , an anti-@@ discrimination body and a general equality law for a scar@@ ce decade .
But it is very slow , as the N@@ S@@ U series showed , to systematically ignore the rac@@ ist mo@@ tive in the police and authorities .
Equ@@ al opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interests of non-@@ white Germans have been demanding for a long time , and what international agreements such as the German Anti-@@ Rac@@ ism Convention are committ@@ ing to do , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of everyone .
In general , Germany is capable of providing medical supplies to the refugees that have been expected to date , according to He@@ z@@ t@@ ep@@ <UNK> Frank Ul@@ rich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; As far as man@@ power and capacity are concerned , we create this , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
However , additional money must be chann@@ elled into the system for this .
In order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for health cards to be handed over to all residents at the same time as regi@@ stering .
Pro@@ mis@@ ed services could later be calculated with the federal states .
And , in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to eat so many people with the limited service catalogue that the law on asylum seekers provides .
Otherwise , doctors will primarily create language barriers .
Until now , Berlin ’ s health scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are better informed about their ill@@ nesses than other patients .
Not only in clin@@ ics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , they are demanding .
However , many refugees would already have had more general medical contact points in the emergency situations .
And with another diagno@@ stic view .
Under refugee conditions , for example , there are significantly more un@@ treated disabilities , and young people are concerned about HIV education .
With some of the other ill@@ nesses , German doctors would be clear from their training , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; Par@@ asi@@ tic cas@@ u@@ alties or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to see , &quot; and , as far as the anger is concerned , refugees may even see relief .
The Syri@@ ans would have a sophisticated education system , and many refugees are even doctors .
However , in order to be able to prac@@ tise , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and perhaps re-@@ examine them .
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are ment@@ ally ill , according to estimates by the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therapy Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post-@@ traum@@ atic distur@@ b@@ ance or depression .
In particular , refugee children , Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , are particularly vulnerable .
A recent study by the T@@ U München shows that every fifth Syri@@ an refugee child arri@@ ves traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
Those who are affected by a post-@@ traum@@ atic distur@@ b@@ ance are suffering , among other things , from so-called f@@ las@@ h@@ backs with resp@@ ir@@ atory trac@@ t , sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes , hear@@ t@@ burn , and fat@@ alities .
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration dis@@ orders , strong anx@@ i@@ ety and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
In order to prevent symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
To date , however , only four per cent of the ment@@ ally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
Although ment@@ ally ill <UNK> um-@@ seekers in the social authorities can make a request for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually la@@ sts several months .
Moreover , in the social authorities , it would be mostly material workers or doctors who are not trained for mental ill@@ nesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This often leads to mis@@ jud@@ gements , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ <UNK> invited to Dre@@ am
With the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; , the Cir@@ cus Prob@@ st takes up the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
The aim is to draw every age group into the bo@@ g of fascinating acro@@ b@@ atics , animal dres@@ ses and unique entertainment .
Now the Cir@@ cus prob@@ st invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the bri@@ ck wall .
&quot; Our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ie Prob@@ st , animal teacher and junior doctor .
&quot; Pas@@ sion &quot; - Under this motto stands the current management st@@ aging .
For more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Prob@@ st family .
So the family is in the blood of the gift to the memory of the op@@ press@@ or .
&quot; It is important for us to bring people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 2@@ 7-@@ year-old junior woman .
&quot; Man@@ ual cocktail with a world city fla@@ ir &quot; , says Rein@@ hard Prob@@ st .
50 cities on the 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this fla@@ ir .
The program of the cir@@ cus conv@@ in@@ ces with tal@@ ented artists from all over the world .
Excellent at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attrac@@ ts the audience with jo@@ ke and charm in their bo@@ g .
The Cas@@ till@@ o Bro@@ thers also understand their cra@@ fts .

Light and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
Her hum@@ or@@ ous art at the M@@ ast is supposed to con@@ quer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
Besides numerous sal@@ mon sal@@ ves , the acro@@ b@@ atics of Cir@@ cus prob@@ st also fascin@@ ates with sensitivity and skill .

Six@@ ty employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; The animals belong to our family &quot; , empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an M@@ other , Bri@@ g@@ itte Prob@@ st .
Mis@@ management in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses is all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
Steph@@ an@@ ie Prob@@ st also takes a position on this : &quot; If our animals are not good , it is not good for us &quot; .
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
The &quot; four-@@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , as they are lov@@ ingly called , will , if possible , be di@@ gest@@ ed by the eyes .
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the man@@ a either .
So the top priority is to ensure that the animals are well car@@ ed for .
The Prob@@ st family is particularly proud of her Z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id J@@ umb@@ o , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Z@@ eb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te .
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; But then , suddenly , was our little J@@ umb@@ o da , &quot; says Bri@@ g@@ itte Prob@@ st .
The Z@@ eb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but for this it is the unique mas@@ co@@ t of Cir@@ cus prob@@ st .
So something should be done for every visitor .
&quot; One is sure , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ie Prob@@ st : &quot; No matter if five or 1 200 spec@@ t@@ ators , we always do our best and are with the heart of it &quot; .
The Cir@@ cus Prob@@ st invites you to his ideas every day from 17 to 20 September .
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 16 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;@@ clock the prices are reduced .

Mr Mugabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell from a po@@ dium at the beginning of the year .
He remained un@@ finished , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
The opening of Parliament was also be@@ aten by alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe &apos;s speech with a fine .
Last month they had suspended him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is what he repeated on Tuesday .
The spo@@ kes@@ man of the Mo@@ vement for Democratic Change ( Mo@@ vement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which they warned against dis@@ rup@@ ting Mr. Mugabe &apos;s address .
&quot; The message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; De@@ ath &apos; , he told journalists after Mugabe &apos;s speech .
It war@@ ns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and , once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &apos; worried &apos; about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30@@ ,000 jobs .
He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25@@ ,000 to 30@@ ,000 jobs as part of the company ’ s restructuring and savings efforts .
HP will later share in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast@@ -@@ growing corporate hardware and services activities .
The expected drop in positions leads to a burden of more than $ 2.@@ 7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in a statement .
&quot; These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ l@@ ett@@ -@@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , H@@ P-@@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation .
&quot; He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
As an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ let@@ t Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ at@@ tained , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; , explains the company .
It shares a company founded in the 1930 ’ s by Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ let@@ t and Da@@ ve Pack@@ ard gradu@@ ates in order to produce electrical plants and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ lic@@ on Valley &quot; .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to overcome the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP ’ s measure , the world ’ s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that close focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ sen@@ al cap@@ tain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team m@@ ates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
W@@ enger empha@@ sized to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
This optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and , given his history , his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain .
The great shame with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; This kind of injury does not threaten the career &quot; , said W@@ enger .
It is a bone that was not well he@@ wn .
This is not a major issue .
This was just an accident .
It was not in connection with his buttons or with the in@@ jur@@ ies he had before .
This may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger also recogni@@ zes , there is a related risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
It also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
The investigation by Premier In@@ jur@@ ies Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his de@@ but six years ago .
He also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 15@@ 7 leag@@ ues in the last five seasons .
The broader picture for Ar@@ senal is that , in six out of eight times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the event days .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the recovery rate will continue during the last season .
&quot; Sometimes when you come back from a injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body will stabili@@ se , I am confident that he will do it and he will pass through a career of the kind he deserves .
Ar@@ senal starts its Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ Le@@ agu@@ e-@@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Ch@@ el@@ sea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ sp@@ ur on Wednesday next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is a ro@@ tation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aar@@ on Ram@@ sey have not trav@@ elled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ thi@@ eu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
W@@ enger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gi@@ b@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to keep the balance and to give the players who need it a small break , &quot; said W@@ enger .
Although Ar@@ senal are clear favor@@ ites to move forward by group F , the Mak@@ sim@@ i Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing areas with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ lucky after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defe@@ at@@ able &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
The stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with 3.2 on the Ju@@ dge scale .
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger believes that Ar@@ senal has learned the lesson of last season with Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ Le@@ agu@@ e-@@ capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the club to its first European victory with its management .
&quot; This drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger .
It has never been fli@@ pped in ar@@ senal .
We were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
We are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships .
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious , especially in view of how the need for men to open themselves has become even more desper@@ ate now than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-@@ year high .
In 2013 , it was the most important cause of death for men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common for men than for women .
In an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ful ( C@@ AL@@ M ) announced in 2015 , as the year of the man , with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Fri@@ end@@ ship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2@@ ,000 high-@@ shock students with de@@ pressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , his chances of recovery doub@@ led .
For those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of ment@@ ally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
But , of course , you must first have friends so that a friendship can work .
In the age of social media communication , with its focus on style about substance , the in@@ <UNK> ability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doub@@ led the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even though in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
This super@@ <UNK> success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which has a much deeper impact on our mental health .
And as a vide@@ og@@ ame invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently said , money can really not buy luck .
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
Each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which was distinguished by the interaction as a friend .
The hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ es , moments at football matches in cosy arm@@ chairs and the long@@ ing of Ro@@ ss to R@@ ach@@ el - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even though they often res@@ ign themselves to fully explore their feelings .
As one of my tel@@ ep@@ hon@@ y staff told me : &quot; My audience role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are end@@ anger@@ ed by suicide has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
The old saying &apos; I &apos;m right with it &apos; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly &apos; .
Friends is one of the shows that comes into my mind when I try to offer lon@@ ger-@@ term support mechanisms .
She clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
As much as my objective external status via the phone may help people in moments of desper@@ ation , long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
And so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
Or , even better if you see someone sitting around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a s@@ mile and say h@@ ello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 23@@ 6 epis@@ odes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
Di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to m@@ elt mal@@ ici@@ des .
Ang@@ el Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Mal@@ <UNK> .
Di Maria meets his de@@ but in the Champ@@ ions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move forward to Mal@@ <UNK> .
Here are the game report and the response to the game .
Ang@@ el Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint-@@ Ger@@ main launched its Champ@@ ions League season with a very comfortable 2-@@ 0 victory against Mal@@ <UNK> in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday .
Di Maria met de@@ but less than four minutes after the start of his Champ@@ ions League deb@@ ut@@ ations as PS@@ G players who brought the French champ@@ ions on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani hit a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
With Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , because they are not only seeking the qualification for the K@@ .@@ O.@@ -@@ Round , but also an improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
But while she got the points , Laur@@ ent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s did not have a class game before the gate , he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he started his illu@@ stri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champ@@ ions League , so it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems for our opponents and look back relaxed , even though there are certain things that we still have to perf@@ ection during the season , &quot; said Blan@@ c .
&quot; This is a good sign .
We wanted to win and we have won , although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more gates . &apos;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Par@@ is-@@ Team after his injury in one of three changes , which could hold a 2 : 2 decision on his own against Bor@@ deaux in the first leag@@ ue on the weekend , but he was broadcast in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
The Argent@@ ine w@@ rec@@ k was called the man who can take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he indicated why , when he ran behind the Mal@@ m Def@@ ense Pass in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass , before leaving Joh@@ an Wil@@ and pretty close to the network for a long time .
But if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Mal@@ <UNK> , which Cel@@ tic suggested in a Pla@@ y-@@ off to achieve this level , appeared with nine national players in the field at An@@ pi@@ ff , and had travel@@ ed with a five-@@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy oppon@@ ent .
But , apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kev@@ in Tra@@ <UNK> posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
Instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some f@@ laws and bad accounts , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who , in no less than five trials , was only patented in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
However , he did much more skill when he put his fellow players into play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which turned Di Maria into a shooting shot directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute of the post ...
After I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a le@@ f@@ ti@@ st f@@ lange of Max@@ well , the second gate finally fell short after the <UNK> brand thanks to Cav@@ ani .
This ended all thought that Mal@@ <UNK> could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ ez@@ zi was finally det@@ ained .
The coach of Mal@@ <UNK> , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norweg@@ i@@ ans said : &quot; Our last Champ@@ ions League match was last December .
Since then , we have only played in the Swedish leag@@ ue , which does not have the same level .
The quali@@ fying games are not enough . &apos;
H@@ ut off in front of Paris !
It was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core coll@@ ects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
The Swiss mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by falling commodity prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its vast school registration plan .
Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth around £ 1.@@ 6 billion to rep@@ ay its own debt .
The company , which lost 57 % of its market value this year , is stru@@ ggling with falling commodity prices , as China ’ s economic down@@ turn is pushing demand and devastating markets .
The issu@@ ance of enti@@ t@@ lement brought Gl@@ en@@ cor@@ es ’ share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange at the early Wednesday morning .
The share j@@ ump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Last week , Gl@@ en@@ core announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to wi@@ pe about one-@@ third of its $ 30 billion debt .
The company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 % of the group .
Conc@@ ern@@ s about long-term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper , and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 % .

The White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
The President of China X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday .
The visit , X@@ i ’ s first official visit to Washington , will take place on September 25 , and President Barack Obama ’ s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
The US President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan this evening at a state d@@ iner , after the two leaders held bilateral talks .
&quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand American cooperation on a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while also giving President Obama and President X@@ i the opportunity to address areas of dis@@ agreement construc@@ tively , &quot; adds the statement .
X@@ I , whose visit was initially announced in February , is likely to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the United Nations General Assembly in September .
Obama and X@@ i are expected to address a number of controversial issues , including Washington ’ s concerns about China ’ s supposed cy@@ ber-@@ sp@@ on@@ age and its growing self-@@ confidence in the disp@@ uted waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola changed to FC Bayern in 2008 .
World and European Championship X@@ avi has been playing for the Al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club in Q@@ atar since summer 2015 .
The FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain ’ s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona at the time .
Ei@@ ght times Spanish Champion , three times po@@ dium winner , four times Champ@@ ion@@ s-@@ Le@@ agu@@ e-@@ winner , two times Klu@@ b World Champion , two times Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
In the summer , the 3@@ 5-@@ year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club to Q@@ atar .
But in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now expects that he had already stood before the EM 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; You told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we nothing &quot; , he told .
And that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; There was an offer from Bavaria &quot; .
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot;
As a remin@@ der : In the summer of 2008 , Jür@@ gen Klin@@ sm@@ ann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change .
However , the change did not come about .
And today the decisive man is working for the German record master : P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has accepted Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM &quot; .
&quot; P@@ ep told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; That is what he has done to me . &quot;
Who knows how Bay@@ ern@@ s game time 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter-@@ fin@@ als of the Champ@@ ions League against the Bavaria across the entire distance of the law@@ n , swit@@ ched the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and finally celebrated the Royal Classic Tri@@ umph .
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on plays a major role in film creation .
Mat@@ t Dam@@ on congrat@@ ulated the Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a debate on diversity and said that she was not needed behind the scenes .
During a episode of Sunday Night by H@@ B@@ Os Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , who under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; When we talk about diversity , then you do it during the occupation of the film and not at the filling of the show &quot; , ins@@ ured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ul@@ ting un@@ belief , and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . Ok@@ ay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian consolidated .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ r@@ ell@@ y-@@ Bro@@ thers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would urge people to think about it - wh@@ o@@ ever the director will be - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; said Brown first .
The only black person , and it is a n@@ ut@@ te be@@ aten by her white p@@ endant .
The producer of De@@ ar White People was in favour of the fin@@ alists Le@@ o Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights of the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ fut@@ ed that their direc@@ ting &quot; might end up giving us something we do not want . &quot;
After the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on ’ s comments .
T@@ wit@@ ter-@@ users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the cli@@ p by writing &quot; Mat@@ t Dam@@ on speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that is S@@ O WE@@ ISS that it h@@ ears &quot; .
The T@@ we@@ et has earned more than 5,000 retail and 4@@ ,000 tickets since its release .
Dam@@ ons ’ comments come at a time when precise ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the for@@ efront of social debate .
After the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ em@@ an in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement had a nation@@ wide impact , and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color insi@@ ghts .
In February , the singer Prince made an all@@ u@@ sion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated alb@@ ums of the year at the Gr@@ amm@@ y Awards .
&quot; album silent matter &quot; , ( Al@@ ben still has their meaning ) he said .
Like books and black life , alb@@ ums still have their meaning .
More recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of Fo@@ x-@@ News personality Elisab@@ eth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be seen as a h@@ ate group .
&quot; The network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
Recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the P@@ ope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the P@@ ope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ns first Champion
Professional sports clim@@ ber and operator assistance I@@ sa@@ ac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Great Prize of $ 1 million home .
The competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never seen a competition participant who could complete all stages of his memory course .
During the season it made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ ero@@ on Ge@@ off B@@ ritt , to the final .
One of the last tasks was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing ro@@ pe in 30 seconds .
Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or , but finished this challenge three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero talked to E ! News after the hard-@@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I think it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; said I@@ sa@@ ac E ! about his b@@ ap@@ tism money .
As suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
The leading producer , K@@ ent W@@ eed , argued with The Hollywood Re@@ por@@ ters to discuss the final and why , although he was the first to complete the course , he did not receive any prize money .
According to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; If there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; said W@@ eed .
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life , it gets the great gramm@@ ati@@ fication .
I do not believe that he has any gri@@ ef about this .
He is just so happy to have done what he did .
He received awards from fans .
He is such a great guy and a family father .
He is a her@@ o for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is I@@ sa@@ ac . &quot;
And I think that I@@ sa@@ ac would have felt the same if she had for@@ got the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eigh@@ th season , the shooting will begin in spring 20@@ 16 .
Det@@ ro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers gr@@ ab M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly f@@ unny for the Det@@ ro@@ it T@@ ig@@ ers .
In the past , they were one of the best teams in Bas@@ eb@@ all , and today the T@@ ig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
The T@@ ig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but on Tuesday they played this part perfectly against the M@@ inn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5-@@ 4 in Tar@@ get F@@ ield .
The T@@ wins wast@@ ed an opportunity to climb within a match of Hou@@ ston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ car@@ d-@@ Platz .
For Det@@ ro@@ it , though only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F-@@ word that was so difficult to gr@@ asp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; All vic@@ tories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said T@@ ig@@ ers Manager Bra@@ d Aus@@ mus .
T@@ ig@@ er-@@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Det@@ ro@@ it was three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then in the sixth and then again in the nin@@ th .
Simon ( 13@@ -@@ 9 ) beat 6 times into the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; said Simon .
It is difficult to throw away any game in the bul@@ l@@ ring , and so I want to go into the game in a very concentrated way .
The designated T@@ ig@@ er-@@ Hit@@ ter Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three h@@ its and was in two r@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid-@@ August .
It was Mart@@ ine@@ z ’ s first Tri@@ -@@ Hit@@ -@@ Game since he had four h@@ its against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; He ha@@ iled the slau@@ gh@@ ter@@ house well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
He looked good at the ( perc@@ ussion training ) , looked much better out of the bul@@ l , and he put it directly into the game .
With three R@@ uns in the rear of the s@@ eventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
Center F@@ iel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the in@@ ning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aar@@ on H@@ ic@@ ks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ em@@ an Bri@@ an Do@@ zi@@ er to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the lin@@ k@@ line Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the <UNK> -@@ design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie Sto@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who escap@@ ed the right-@@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ ha@@ gen with a Tw@@ o-@@ R@@ un .
With a pair of run@@ ners and the sh@@ utter run at the second , Ver@@ ha@@ gen brought the third Bas@@ em@@ an Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e to a Double Play .
It was the leading 27@@ th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e beat a Double Play .
After Det@@ ro@@ it added an In@@ sur@@ ance-@@ R@@ un at the end of the nin@@ th interior , Wall created a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser of the T@@ ig@@ ers Bru@@ ce R@@ ond@@ on and reached the level of 5-@@ 4 .
However , the ri@@ b@@ bon st@@ ems from S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth sail .
Det@@ ro@@ it benef@@ ited from an un@@ moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es to start the game .
The T@@ ig@@ ers reached three races in the first two Inn@@ ings against the righ@@ te@@ ous veter@@ an , who had been removed from the <UNK> ten@@ list prior to the game , after having f@@ lown more than a month due to a set@@ back .

A Tw@@ o-@@ Out Wal@@ k for J@@ .@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Vic@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .

H@@ und@@ <UNK> of refugees in Wies@@ baden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ essen .
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
The people who were attracted should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency accommodation in Wies@@ baden , as the city of Wies@@ baden told on Tuesday evening .
It was estimated that there were 450 to 750 refugees .
Several sports halls of the capital of H@@ esse have been prepared for this case in the last few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily lost there .
They should then be distributed further to other communities .
Only in the last ten days , according to the govern@@ or of G@@ <UNK> 7@@ 500 , who is responsible for the first time , had arrived in H@@ essen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : Germany ’ s Milit@@ ary Meas@@ ures in Syria An Option
The head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German participation in Syria to be an opportunity .
&quot; I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
He accused the European states of &apos; collective for@@ esi@@ ght &apos; .
Four years ago , we were pleased that the Kel@@ ch was involved in military participation in Germany .
&quot; Now the conflict ends up on our door@@ step , &quot; he said in German radio .
The former German amb@@ ass@@ ador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Inter@@ ior Minister <UNK> a Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F that no one will be sent back to Hungary now .
Germany , too , has not sent refugees back to Austria .
&quot; No , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
On the question of an agreement whereby Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mi@@ kl@@ -@@ Lei@@ tner said that there had already been talks on this subject between the Director@@ -@@ General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
She did not call specific figures and pointed out talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
In recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary .
Their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , asked for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday .
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
On Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU Inter@@ ior Ministers intend to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees at a special meeting .
In view of the strong refugee population in Germany , the Federal Government wants to give greater support to countries in the initial and distribution of human beings .
The B@@ und will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the prime ministers in the office of Chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel pointed out that those people who need protection would have it .
But if you do not have a lead perspective , you cannot stay in Germany either .
This view was agreed in the round .
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now needs to cope with a &apos; huge effort &apos; .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
A few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania should also be clear@@ ed off with a f@@ ence .
This neighbouring country , unlike Serbia , is part of the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from looking for broken routes over Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to , on the planned new border f@@ ence .
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan .
There were first arres@@ ts of people who had cut the f@@ ence .
In Turkey , according to reports of ey@@ e-@@ cat@@ chers , thousands more migrants were on the way to the Greek border .

This includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ec@@ raft &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; .
As a result , the moon appears slightly on its track around the ring plan@@ ets .
Although this di@@ ver movement is only small , it is still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( United States State of New York ) of Tuesday .
The researchers present their analyses in the journ@@ al &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; .
For a long time it was known that there must be flu@@ id water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
Thus , &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes on the southern pole of the Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds in 2006 , sp@@ un the water va@@ pour and iron partic@@ les , and thus feed the so-called E-@@ ring of the Satur@@ n .
At least on the South P@@ ole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
However , the extension of the hidden oc@@ e@@ ans was not clarified .
R@@ ama missing several weeks in 18@@ 60 Munich
The 18@@ 60 Munich has to ren@@ ounce Offen@@ si@@ v@@ ak@@ er-@@ Val@@ det R@@ ama around a month .
An investigation has resulted in an injury to the 2@@ 7-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , reported the association with .

According to Mün@@ chner Lö@@ wen , the diagnosis means &quot; presum@@ ably four weeks of compulsory break &quot; .
&quot; This is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a great loss . &quot;
&quot; Of course we need to think now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ sme@@ n of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess professional .

No di@@ etary meal - Man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ ic@@ y sweet .
But if you want to pay attention to your lean line , you will often get away from it .
Because man@@ goes contain quite a lot of sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
However , the exotic fruits are still alive : in them , B vit@@ am@@ ins and vit@@ am@@ ins E and C. Above all , man@@ goes contain a lot of vit@@ amin A and its pre-@@ stage bet@@ a body .
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and met@@ abo@@ lic processes in the body .
When buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
The ink alone says nothing about how rich the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very delicious .
They should be stored at room temperature and consum@@ ed within a few days .
Then , of course , you can taste pure or sweet dishes .
A man@@ go , however , also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
It allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some b@@ lat@@ ts@@ al@@ ate such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
And a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lam@@ b and game .

The company has already begun to recru@@ it seasonal workers , announced UPS on Tuesday .
In particular , drivers are being sought .
Already last year , UPS had increased its presence for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 grants .
Given the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ E@@ x have been making arrangements for Christmas business for the past year .
In 2013 , delayed deliveries had severely critici@@ zed the package services .
First F@@ öh@@ n@@ stur@@ m , then striking Cold Front
The next night breaks down in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz reported on Tuesday .
On Wednesday and at night on Thursday , the F@@ öh@@ n b@@ lows partly with storm strength through the valleys of the F@@ öh@@ n@@ tal .
After the da@@ wn on Thursday morning , we cross a striking col@@ d-@@ front that brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ all , wind so@@ ils and a temperature drop .
As Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently at the for@@ efront of a comprehensive low-@@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong Sou@@ th-@@ West current .
On the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n .
As a result , the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning b@@ lows together in the valleys of Boh@@ em@@ ia with so@@ ils from 60 to 100 km / h , and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly with over 100 km / h .
The F@@ öh@@ n can pen@@ et@@ rate up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even or@@ ch@@ ards of more than 120 km / h .
While in the north on Wednesday cr@@ ash@@ ing F@@ öh@@ n causes <UNK> able temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , hum@@ idity on the Alpine slope begins to develop .
This is where rain starts , which la@@ sts until Thursday evening .
In sum , over 100 li@@ tres of rain per square met@@ re will have to be expected in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , which has already fallen in the last few days .
On Thursday morning , the F@@ öh@@ n is out of the air , as a result of which a cold front roll@@ s over Switzerland with strong , partly wei@@ ghted rain from West to East .
Together with the col@@ d-@@ front , the wind refres@@ hes sharp@@ ly to stor@@ my , and temperatures decline significantly .

Rome now has a Mart@@ in-@@ Lu@@ ther Square
Almost 500 years after the Re@@ formation , there is now a Mart@@ in-@@ Lu@@ ther Square in Rome .
In the presence of Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , on Wednesday , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed on the name of the German reform@@ ator .
In the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now recognized as &quot; German the@@ ologist of Re@@ formation &quot; .
The park is located in the heart of old Rome , right next to the Co@@ li@@ se@@ um .
The name was requested by the working community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
J@@ ens@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , past@@ or of the Evangel@@ ic-@@ Lu@@ ther@@ an community in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the P@@ ä@@ p@@ ste were often able to live their faith only in secret for centuries as a minority .
With the place will be seen in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome to Rome .
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
At the time , he perceived the city as a lost scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
His negative impres@@ sions are likely to have served him by hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Lu@@ ther then had begun the sec@@ ession of the de@@ port@@ ed church with his thes@@ es against the de@@ fl@@ ection .
H@@ ammer Arti@@ sts invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bi@@ ble .
Jesus with the ( gol@@ d-@@ pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ r@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Al@@ t painted for his Bi@@ ble .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post wrote the introduction and updated Bi@@ ble Tex@@ ts .
At the beginning was the word ?
No , not the Ot@@ mar@@ -@@ Al@@ t-@@ Bi@@ ble , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
At the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Al@@ t , who in 150 mo@@ ti@@ fs formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of bi@@ b@@ lical stories on paper and can@@ vas .
His &quot; language &quot; with color@@ ful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 7@@ 5-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; f@@ unny &quot; images .
On the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ om@@ y to adapt the issues concerned .
Around three years , Ot@@ mar Al@@ t has worked on his Bi@@ ble project , for which he has made a subj@@ ective artistic selection from the many themes of the book of all books .
These are cycles dedicated to topics such as cross@@ roads , p@@ ills , comm@@ and@@ ments or fa@@ thers .
He has spont@@ ane@@ ously fascin@@ ated several partners : this applies to Lu@@ ther@@ -@@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as to K@@ ett@@ ler@@ -@@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
And here is the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who , on the basis of painting , has dealt with the respective bi@@ b@@ lical sites .
He has interpreted the bi@@ o-@@ sites selected by Ot@@ mar Al@@ t and so translated into &quot; current contex@@ ts &quot; .
These texts are like verb@@ al mir@@ rors of Al@@ ts painting .
They are embedded between the original Bi@@ ble of Martin Lu@@ ther and one set of the artist , who sets out here his own personal thoughts on the situation in question .
The je@@ wel@@ ry collection has golden letters .
Thus , the 7@@ 5-@@ year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
This is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
Emo@@ tions were ultimately at all the trigger for the Bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Al@@ t , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protest@@ ant rul@@ er Or@@ den .
&quot; This is where education was done with the pi@@ pel@@ ines , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Al@@ t .
&quot; I have tried to do this to perhaps return to the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot;
His second concern is to restore the importance of art in a fast@@ -@@ pac@@ ed time : &quot; The perception of the worlds of images is now marked by advertising , and that is loud .
Sy@@ mbo@@ lic is being squ@@ ee@@ zed out there .
Arti@@ sts have a different desire to show things .
Images always have something secret and are not decor@@ ative .
&quot; In this respect I am a din@@ o@@ sa@@ ur &quot; .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ t wants the viewer to &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; , to be able to influence them , to discover and feel the power they have : &quot; The picture is looking for his counter@@ part &quot; .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post step@@ ped on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar@@ -@@ Al@@ t-@@ Bi@@ ble in the Ot@@ mar@@ -@@ Alt@@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lo@@ ver of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts to be art : &quot; I like as he understands with his pictures &quot; .
Al@@ t did not care to fully capture the Bi@@ ble , but chose the issues that are important to him , including mysteri@@ ous ones .
&quot; This was not cooperation on an equal footing , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; This is about the images , the text only explains &quot; .
For Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Lu@@ ther@@ -@@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom &quot; .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( bi@@ b@@ lical ) language of love and the responsibility .
Part of the origin@@ als - paper and paint pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar@@ -@@ Alt@@ Foundation .
Beg@@ inning of construction for BM@@ X@@ -B@@ ahn
Plans made , place found , commissioned companies to model ground h@@ ub@@ s for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X@@ -B@@ ahn it was finished again .
Def@@ ici@@ encies in politics and administration have led to land@@ sli@@ des , especially among those who did not want to toler@@ ate the railways .
So move up hill , search for new place - now with formal planning and request for construction permit .
The approval will be received in October , the first local coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or , Sab@@ ine Mos@@ eb@@ ach@@ -@@ Bo@@ ck , has now been able to communicate in the Committee on Children and Youth .
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said .
It would then be necessary to start work in the former indoor swimming pool without any further rec@@ ess .
D@@ F@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
The D@@ F@@ B <UNK> its commitment to refugees by 20@@ 19 , the Bundes@@ lig@@ a sends out a clear signal at the weekend .
Foot@@ ball respon@@ ds to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and provides political support to deal with the problems that lie ahead .
&quot; I believe that this is the greatest challenge facing our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; In principle , no one can say that this does not affect me , I have nothing to do with it &quot; .
&quot; This must be of interest to everyone to get to gri@@ ps with this issue , &quot; said D@@ F@@ B-@@ CEO Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach .
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely .
&quot; I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; There will certainly be a central role to play &quot; , he announced .
Foot@@ ball can and should help .
However , the decisive course must be political .
The German Foot@@ ball League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; About the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us@@ -B@@ ra@@ un@@ -@@ Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 20@@ 19 , &quot; said N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach , on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of the U@@ EFA meeting in St. Juli@@ an &apos;s / Malta .
Some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
Already this weekend the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign if they will bear the pressure &quot; We help - # <UNK> es@@ welcome &quot; on the left-@@ hand car@@ to@@ on sle@@ eve instead of the usual spons@@ or logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only do so , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en ’ s sports director Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self-@@ evident &quot; .
&quot; The refugee drama goes to everyone , no one can look away . &quot;
&quot; We football leag@@ ues can , no , we need to use our radiation power , our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have already suffered so un@@ believ@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ th@@ a Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the leag@@ ue &quot; .
On this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication match against Hungary .
N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach referred to the support of refugees as &apos; a large community of German football &apos; .
The fact that all 36 licence clubs had started their own projects in their places is great .
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
The message &apos; 1 : 0 for a welcome &apos; that we have issued will be lived in football .
&quot; This is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
In this year and next year , the association , together with the D@@ F@@ B selection and the Federal Government , will provide EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; The clubs have already retri@@ ev@@ ed the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; N@@ ier@@ s@@ bach reported .
Re@@ ports : SAP Chief Executive Officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
According to several reports , the leader of Europe ’ s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
In the event of an accident at the sta@@ ir@@ case in the house of his brother in the United States , he had fallen to a water glass after mid@@ night , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; He is almost hidden , was im@@ pot@@ ent , then took himself straight to the street - he told us so last week &quot; , quot@@ es the &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; SAP co-@@ founder of H@@ asso Plat@@ tner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , however , can do his job .
&quot; At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ tner .
The 54 years old manager was present at the meeting and &quot; fully operational &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP there , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; Of course , I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ tner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually ends between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
It is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; Everyone can happen this kind of thing . &quot;
&quot; It is important to stand up again when you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ Lar@@ en-@@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from fi@@ re-@@ fighting ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twi@@ t@@ ched a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was cr@@ ashed from the wheel .
So he doesn ’ t question either of the two main pil@@ ots Fern@@ ando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button when he reti@@ red in Singapore on the weekend , as he did a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
Foot@@ ball : B@@ V@@ B without R@@ eus against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the Tor
At Bor@@ us@@ sia Dor@@ t@@ mund , all hopes of a com@@ eb@@ ack by Marco R@@ eus have finally broken out in the first group game of the Europe League .
The national player will also be ab@@ sent from the football leag@@ ue table leader in the du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; Unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
Whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a match against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B-@@ Co@@ ach left open : &quot; We expect him to return to the training session on Friday &quot; .
In view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his tri@@ bal el@@ even to the real position .
Thus , he announced a change on the Tor@@ b@@ ole position .
This is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occup@@ ies the place of tri@@ ke@@ eper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; He trained at an absolute top level &quot; , the football teacher pra@@ ised the world champion .
However , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it clear whether wh@@ it@@ e@@ wash@@ ers will be used in all Europe ’ s Le@@ agu@@ e-@@ Games in the future .
It is also very likely that he will deny the second game .
The for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final score for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , says mid@@ field player Juli@@ an Wei@@ gl to understand : &quot; That &apos;s not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot;
Robo@@ ter@@ au@@ tos : Government wants a pione@@ ering role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be the technological pione@@ er in the change of the car according to the wishes of the Federal Government .
On Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Ministers Alexander D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investment in the development of digital infrastructure .
D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt , on the outs@@ kir@@ ts of the Autom@@ esse IA@@ A , of a &quot; new age of mobility &quot; .
Autom@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic j@@ ams , said D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt .
He also wants to discuss this issue with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries , which also meet with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
The Ministry of Transport ’ s strategy paper empha@@ sizes , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio .
To test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
In order to avoid any additional liability risks , the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt it to the new developments .
Germany , for example , wants to work internationally to raise the per@@ missible maximum speed for self-@@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km .
The Federal Government also wants to see an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which so far only provides for people as drivers .
In automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Econom@@ ics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
Nevertheless , driving cars on public roads are &apos; only to be expected by 2020 &apos; .
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; The digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; said the SP@@ D transport politi@@ cian S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
However , the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of drivers &apos; personal data must be clear .
But German self-@@ driving cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
A pol@@ l submitted on Wednesday at the AA by the For@@ sa@@ -@@ Institute on behalf of the audit organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self-@@ driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 % expect only in 20 years , 31 % do not believe in it at all .
In France , 21 % of respon@@ dents expect self-@@ driving cars up to 20@@ 25 , 33 % in the US .
O@@ h@@ <UNK> drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-@@ driving vehicle .
According to a survey by the Bit@@ k@@ om digital association , only seven percent would agree to hand over control over all roads throughout the journey .
On the motorway , however , this could be expected to be 15 % in f@@ lowing traffic , 45 % in St@@ au .
Good for each Four@@ th would leave the car under no circumstances to control .
B@@ oll says team and double start at Tis@@ cht@@ enn@@ is-@@ EM .
After the current state of play , the <UNK> dor@@ fer only wants to start the title battle from September 25 to October 4 .
The final decision will be taken on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; This is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; The guys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; However , we are strong enough to get the title even without Tim@@ o , &quot; said Bund@@ est@@ ra@@ iner J@@ ör@@ g Ro@@ ß@@ kop@@ f during the EM course in Düsseldorf .
B@@ oll was on the flight at this time at a long-term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
The 34 years old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; Without Tim@@ o is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained single European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
The Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM of 2013 in Sch@@ <UNK> at .
&apos;@@ At that time , Tim@@ o also broke , and we have become a European champion . &apos;
&quot; This is what we should be aiming for , &quot; said the world class .
The English football player Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a severe injury to the right leg .

G@@ aul@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible .
It is a mixture of great fashion shows and a wa@@ x figur@@ e-@@ grey cab@@ inet : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
The highlights are : sta@@ ir@@ cases that look aw@@ fully human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
They wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and thus that he put men in sk@@ ir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; Ear@@ lier it was ble@@ ak , now it is real , &quot; said G@@ aul@@ tier .
For the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Si@@ de@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the ci@@ ph@@ er to the run@@ way ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ th@@ alle der Hy@@ po@@ -@@ Kultur@@ sti@@ ftung , it is a good thing that the fashion artist has changed his initially negative attitude to a shooting about his person .
Ac@@ tually he was against , because &quot; For me , an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; he said .
When you die , you come to the museum .
The impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; It &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes &quot; , said the director of the Kuns@@ th@@ alle , Rog@@ er Di@@ eder@@ en .
It concerns tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
The exhi@@ bits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
Chr@@ on@@ ologically , the display is not built , but it is an excellent ch@@ ore@@ og@@ rap@@ ed overall work for which a lot of effort has been made : for example , a sty@@ list has been specially engaged in the restoration of the d@@ olls .
14 tons of material have driven the mach@@ er to Munich according to the cur@@ ator Th@@ ier@@ ry Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
Sh@@ or@@ tly before the start of the Ok@@ to@@ ber@@ fest there was a special war@@ dro@@ be : a leather ho@@ se out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Mad@@ onna .
He has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sm@@ ar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , G@@ aul@@ tier said .
Also G@@ aul@@ tiers old T@@ ed@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
He stands for the first , tim@@ eless fashion attempts by the designer .
As a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he used his T@@ ed@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , G@@ aul@@ tier said .
With a d@@ oll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
He then contributed to the design of fashion himself later .
He ste@@ ered fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as G@@ aul@@ tier told in Munich .
Later I bought them but of course .
For his first own fashion show he did not pay the models .
They did not get anything , but they were allowed to keep the fle@@ ets .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion ni@@ che
In the past , the long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around the pl@@ um were about to make met@@ re .
The em@@ bro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and l@@ enses were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , continued to work on ceilings and gar@@ den@@ ers .
This alone no longer works today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ des@@ pit@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en .
Instead , fashion is important again .
Fas@@ hion played a greater role in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ter Le@@ ader , then was squ@@ ee@@ zed out by the domestic textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a ni@@ che .
Rein@@ hardt describes some examples : lead in je@@ wel@@ ry , accessories like po@@ ckets and regional cost@@ umes .
In addition , the so-called vin@@ tage fashion , which is based on past styles , is an increasing potential for order .
Anyone who does not serve ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
With us they already make up half of all orders .
Mo@@ des@@ pit@@ ze P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener spitze and em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y .
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
In the last 15 years , around 80 % of turnover has gone away .
Private shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
Our products hardly reach the customer by this way .
Today , mass goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and are distributed almost exclusively through chains .
In addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and the US .
So there are good reasons for new ways .
The industry association also tries to point out environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; Since this year we have been producing a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible &quot; .
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; This also applies to the materials used &quot; .
Diplom@@ atic designer U@@ te Schmi@@ dt te@@ aches at the Snow@@ e@@ berger Aus@@ enst@@ elle of the Western Sax@@ ony University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ul@@ ty of App@@ lied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ ies and tips .
In order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian area , we need to find high-quality and innovative products .
It takes time and courage .
There is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses , which mainly need to think economically , &quot; says Schmi@@ dt .
Therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
A few years ago , textile designer K@@ ati Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
In some places , the machine sti@@ cks small kit@@ chens .
The P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ forge champ@@ ionship in Bi@@ an@@ ca Hal@@ leb@@ ach@@ -K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; Before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip &quot; .
Now it uses the snow@@ ball tip for its je@@ wel@@ ry .
In an elabor@@ ate procedure , it character@@ iz@@ es the pattern in silver .
&quot; Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener spitze - young and old &quot; , says Re@@ uter .
It also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancest@@ ors have lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want a piece of change .
So I see my je@@ wel@@ ry as a modern amb@@ ass@@ ador of the P@@ lau@@ ghter Le@@ ader .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
After all , people don &apos;t want to be an@@ gr@@ y , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; .
According to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; , however , this is not about re-@@ fil@@ ming , but about a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first movie with the magic child &apos;s mother .
It is about the experiences of N@@ ann@@ y with the B@@ anks family in times of Great Depression in England .
Anyone who plays p@@ opp@@ ies more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
But the director is already clear : R@@ ob Mar@@ shall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
X@@ i insi@@ sts on opening the economy more broadly to the world .
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to encourage growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , on Tuesday , a group charged with ste@@ ering the reform .
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and to improve business star@@ t-@@ ups strategies , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the central management group to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform .
Pro@@ mot@@ ing new star@@ t-@@ ups and adv@@ ancing reforms will bring new momentum and vit@@ ality and provide new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
The management group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for regulating market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state-@@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residential reporting system .
According to the statement , a negative list is drawn up which identi@@ fies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in al@@ loc@@ ating resources , guarantees a constitutional business environment and makes the market more open , said the statement .
The government will also ease controls on the powers confer@@ red on companies and ensure that companies decide how to do business .
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
As part of an offer to open state-@@ controlled sectors , other areas are opened up for private investment .
&quot; The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of le@@ ver@@ aged companies and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement .
In addition , it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilitating the application process .
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors has also been discussed at a meeting .
The meeting also included Premier L@@ i Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
The EU wants to double the mer@@ cury threshold in pre@@ dat@@ ors
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large quantities of pre@@ dat@@ ors and thus to give consumers a significantly higher dose of ner@@ ve gifts .
The consumer organisation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , which has a corresponding working document from the EU , strongly critici@@ zed the plans : &apos; Ris@@ ks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregn@@ ant women and inf@@ ants &apos; , said Matthias <UNK> sch@@ mi@@ dt of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
According to <UNK> sch@@ mi@@ dt , the limit values of the ner@@ ve for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish for reasons of economic policy , from one to two milli@@ gram@@ s of mer@@ cury per ki@@ lo@@ <UNK> fish .
However , large car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the remaining limits , approximately 50 % of cat@@ ches should not be sold .
After dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 % would be un@@ available .
In return for this relaxation , according to F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram@@ s to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram@@ s of mer@@ cury per ki@@ lo@@ <UNK> .
F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , however , referred to this as &quot; tri@@ ck &quot; because smaller gra@@ ve@@ yard fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximum values today .
The reduction in small businesses is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous di@@ version that only helps the economy &quot; , explained <UNK> sch@@ mi@@ dt .
Mer@@ cury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is greatly enrich@@ ed by the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
The Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities can cause un@@ born damage to the ner@@ vous system &quot; .
The Federal Ministry of the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on its homepage , declar@@ es that a &apos; health haz@@ ard for the general population &apos; is not expected .
Mer@@ cury mainly comes into the environment through coal comb@@ us@@ tion .
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red power plants will receive more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury per year from Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , two-@@ thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
The concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , for example in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; permanently and everywhere &quot; , said the &quot; mirror &quot; in March .
Last year , pan@@ -European war@@ nings of mer@@ cury in fish were already among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
